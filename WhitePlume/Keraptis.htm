<div class="wholedoc">
	<h1>The Legend of Keraptis<strong><img height="330%" src="Keraptis.jpg" style="float: right" width="40%" class="auto-style16"></strong></h1>
	<p>Well over a millenium ago, the wizard Keraptis rose to power in the 
	valleys of the northern mountains, bringing the local warlords under his 
	thumb with gruesome threats&mdash;threats that were fulfilled just often enough to 
	keep the leaders in line. Under Keraptis' overlordship, the influx of 
	rapacious monsters and raids from the wild mountains decreased markedly, 
	dwindled, and then almost stopped. Seeing this, the populace did not put up 
	much resistance to paying Keraptis' rather heavy taxes and tithes, 
	especially when stories of what happened to those who balked were 
	circulated. Those lords who protested disappeared in the night and were 
	replaced by the next in the line of succession, who was usually inclined to 
	be more tractable than his predecessor.</p>
	<p>Gradually, as all dissension was 
	stilled, the taxes and levies became even more burdensome, until eventually 
	the wizard was taking a large piece of everything that was grown, made, or 
	sold in the valleys, including the newborn young of livestock. Around this 
	time there began numerous reports in the land of sudden madnesses, demonic 
	possessions, and sightings of apparitions and undead. Furthermore, monstrous 
	incursions into the settled lands began to increase as raiding parties of 
	humanoids burnt whole villages, and evil and fantastic monsters appeared 
	from nowhere to prey upon the harried peasants. At the height of these 
	outrages came Keraptis' tax-collectors with word of a new levy&mdash;one third of 
	all newborn children were henceforth to be turned over to the wizard!</p>
	<p>As 
	one, the people rose and destroyed the sorcerer's hierarchy and marched on 
	his keep, where, led by a powerful and good cleric and his ranger acolytes, 
	they destroyed Keraptis' minions. The great wizard barely managed to escape 
	to the south, accompanied only by his personal bodyguard company of deranged 
	and fanatical evil gnomes.</p>
	<p>Keraptis fled to the cities of the south and 
	west, but wherever he went, his reputation preceded him, and he was unable 
	to stay anywhere for long. Once again retiring north, he came to the shores 
	of the Lake of Unknown Depths, where he heard tales of haunted White Plume 
	Mountain. Investigating further, he at last found the refuge he was looking 
	for in the tangled maze of volcanic tunnels beneath the cone. He and his 
	gnomes vanished into the shadow of the Plume, and humankind heard no more of 
	the evil wizard.</p>
	<p>That was almost thirteen hundred years before the present 
	day. Now, seemingly, the hand of Keraptis is once again interfering in human 
	affairs. If it is in truth the ancient wizard at work here, can he be 
	thwarted before his power grows once more? What is his purpose in this 
	bizarre challenge to the world's heroes? There is only one way to find out.</p>
