	Menzoberranzan, City&nbsp;of&nbsp;Spiders</h1>
	<p>Menzoberranzan is a drow city located north of the Darklake.
	As with most drow cities, Menzoberranzan is divided into number of noble 
	houses and ruled by priestesses of <a href="Gods/Lolth.htm">Lolth</a>. Betrayal and assassination are a 
	way of life here, and a cruel and suspicious nature is a sign of good 
	breeding.</p>
	<p>Menzoberranzan is one of the few drow cities located in the Upperworld. The city occupies an irregularly shaped cavern more
than 2 miles wide at its widest point. The ceiling is 1,000 feet
high, and stalactites, stalagmites, and columns litter the cavern.
All of them have been worked or shaped, and the continuous
effect across the entire cavern can be mesmerizing to the uninitiated.
Some of the larger stalagmites have been converted to
castles and homes for drow noble Houses. These sparkle with
permanent <em>
	<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/f/faerie-fire/">faerie fire</a></em> effects, creating a soft, multicolored
glow that suffuses the cavern.</p>
	<p>The city has many different factions, or Houses, all of which vie for 
	power. Officially, the city is ruled by the Council of Eight, composed of 
	the eight matron mothers of the first (and most powerful) eight 
	houses.&nbsp;However, for some time the most powerful house has been House 
	Baerne,&nbsp;which is governed by Matron Mother Yvonnel Baerne, whose power is 
	uncontested.</p>
	<img style="float: left; padding-right:10px" width="50%" src="Braeryn.jpg"><h3>
	The Braeryn</h3>
	<p>The Braeryn (also known as &quot;the Stenchstreets&quot;) is a shantytown of 
	ramshackle structures overlooking garbage-choked alleyways, inhabited by the 
	dregs of<br>drow society. Fallen priestesses, bankrupt merchants, escaped 
	slaves, and the homeless or maimed are common here, as are visitors to the 
	city who wish to go unnoticed. Drow refer to the inhabitants of Braeryn as 
	&quot;undercreatures&quot;.</p>
	<p>A common sport for nobles was a Hunt through the Braeryn, in which nobles 
	killed any undercreatures they saw. During this time, anybody on the street 
	was denied entry for fear of risking the occupants of a building. Trophies 
	from the Hunt often included teeth, ears, and heads of the inhabitants, 
	including drow.</p>
