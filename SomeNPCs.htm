	<h1>Some NPC's</h1>
	<img height="330%" src="Dyllon.jpg" style="float: right" width="40%" class="auto-style16">
	<h2>Dyllon Ungart</h2>
	<p>Dyllon is a duergar paladin who is a member of <strong>the</strong><em><strong>
	</strong></em><strong>Unseen</strong>, a 
	secret organization of good and neutral followers of <strong>St.&nbsp;Cuthbert</strong> who 
	combat mind flayers and aboleths and guard the world against extraplanar 
	incursions from hell, the abyss, and the far realm.&nbsp; Members of the 
	Unseen also participate in more mundane heroic adventures, such as fighting 
	derro and gibberlings, slaying powerful demons or evil dragons, and so 
	forth.</p>
	<p>Dyllon is based in the duergar city of Gracklstugh, where he poses as a travelling merchant who dabbles in adventuring.&nbsp; 
	In addition to more mundane roles, he is always on the lookout for the 
	arrival of <strong>the Lightbringers</strong> prophesied by the <strong>Air Weird</strong>.&nbsp; 
	According to the Weird, the Lightbringers will be four mysterious travellers 
	in Gracklstugh who can perceive the future and are destined to fill the 
	world with heaven's light.&nbsp; Dyllon believes this prophecy may refer the 
	four party members.</p>
	<p>Like you, Dyllon 
	is currently staying at the <strong>Cold Foundry Inn</strong> in Gracklstugh. You have 
	adventured with him several times in the last month, though you didn't 
	understand his true nature until your most recent adventure.&nbsp; He seems 
	to have good contacts in Gracklstugh, including <strong>Gartokkar Firehand
	</strong>(see below) and a former captain of the Stone Guard named<strong> 
	Idwal Coalhewer</strong>. You don't know much about Dyllon's background, but he did tell Jaeden 
	a story about his experience in a gigantic Lowerworld rift known as the Maddening Dark.</p>
	<p>Dyllon is tall for a duergar, and his skin has a bit more color than 
	most, owing to his urdunnir grandfather.&nbsp; Dyllon, Lavor, and Jaeden are 
	currently under arrest by the Stone Guard and locked in Overlake Hold.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<img height="330%" src="Thikka.jpg" style="float: left" width="30%" class="auto-style16">
	<h2>Thikka</h2>
	<p>Thikka is a ratfolk alchemist who lives in Gracklstugh and is good 
	friends with Dyllon.&nbsp; Like him, Thikka is a member of the Unseen.&nbsp; 
	Dyllon introduced you to her some time ago, and at the time she seemed 
	unusually interested in human culture.</p>
	<p>Thikka was attacked by the followers of Yog-Sothoth while you were on 
	your most recent adventure.&nbsp; A <em>baleful polymorph</em> spell turned 
	her into a mundane rat, but Morgana managed to reverse the effects using a
	<em>dispel magic</em>.&nbsp; Morgana and Thikka are currently hiding in a 
	permanent <em>rope trick</em> safehouse in Gracklstugh created by the Unseen.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<img height="330%" src="DrowVampire.jpg" style="float: right" width="30%" class="auto-style16">
	<h2>Zov</h2>
	<p>Zov is drow vampire and a member of the cult of Yog-Sothoth.&nbsp; He 
	casts divine spells including <em>fleshworm infestation</em> and <em>black 
	tentacles</em> (both 4th level spells), and his drow <em>shadow cloak</em> 
	makes it difficult to attack him physically.</p>
	<p>Zov participated in the attack on Dyllon at the Cold Foundry Inn, 
	together with the medusa Euryale (see below) and the avolakia Shuy-Nil (now 
	dead).&nbsp; Forced into gaseous form, he escaped into the whorlstone 
	tunnels underneath the city, where his coffin is presumably located.</p>
	<p>Zov later appeared to Jaeden in a dream using some form of magical 
	communication.&nbsp; He claims to be a former member of the Unseen who 
	abandoned the organization after becoming a vampire.&nbsp; He argues that 
	the world is a terrible place full of evil and suffering, and that the only 
	rational response is to work towards its end.&nbsp; He also claims that the 
	party members are the &quot;scions of Yog-Sothoth&quot;, and have been sent here by 
	the elder evil to destroy the world.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<img height="330%" src="medusa.gif" style="float: left" width="25%" class="auto-style16">
	<h2>Euryale</h2>
	<p>Euryale is a medusa witch and a member of the cult of Yog-Sothoth.&nbsp; 
	She has access to 5th-level spells such as <em>baleful polymorph</em> and 
	also the <em>ice tomb</em> major hex (usually only available 
	to witches of 10th level and higher).</p>
	<p>Euryale participated in the attack on Dyllon at the Cold Foundry Inn, 
	together with the drow vampire Zov (see above) and the avolakia Shuy-Nil 
	(now dead). She ran upstairs near the end of the battle and then somehow 
	disappeared&mdash;Lavor was unable to find her on the second floor despite 
	no obvious exits.</p>
	<p>According to Zov, Euryale is &quot;quite taken&quot; with Jaeden, whatever that 
	means.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<img height="330%" src="Firehand.jpg" style="float: right" width="23%" class="auto-style16"><h2>Gartokkar 
	Firehand</h2>
	<p>Gartokkar Firehand is the head of the <strong>Firehand clan</strong>, one 
	of the main smithing clans in Gracklstugh.&nbsp; The Firehands are renowned 
	for their armor, but they also sell weapons and other goods. The Firehand 
	clan wields significant political power in the city, and are universally 
	feared.</p>
	<p>Gartokkar hired the party to rescue his youngest son<strong> </strong>Thar 
	Firehand after Thar and his company were ambushed by derro near Murgol's Hollow. 
	The party later found Thar dead but were able to save his son Ivar as well 
	as recover the bodies of Thar and his wife Ulara.</p>
	<img height="330%" src="Beholder.png" style="float: left" width="35%" class="auto-style16">
	<h2>Thaluul</h2>
	<p>Thaluuls is the head enforcer for the Firehand clan, and reports directly 
	to Gartokkar.&nbsp; He has a reputation for both intelligence and cruelty, 
	and he is rumored to be heavily involved in the decision-making 
	for the Firehand business.</p>
	<p>Thaluul is apparently an expert in languages and was surprised to hear 
	the party speaking a language that he does not know.&nbsp; He has since asked 
	Jaeden to tutor him in Common, and offered to free him from the 
	duergar prison for that purpose.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h2><img height="330%" src="Gengir.jpg" style="float: right" width="30%" class="auto-style16">Gengir Ironhead</h2>
	<p>Gengir is an officer in the Stone Guard who works as a spy for the mind flayers. He arrested Dyllon, Lavor, and Jaeden after the battle with the
	cult of Yog-Sothoth and interrogated them aggressively, in an apparent abuse 
	of his authority.</p>
	<p>Dyllon discovered some time ago that Gengir was compromised by the mind 
	flayers and shared this information with the leadership of the guard. Rather 
	than arrest him, the decision was made to keep Gengir in place and monitor 
	his activities.</p>
