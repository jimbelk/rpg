	<img alt="A Mind Flayer" height="240" src="MindFlayer.gif" style="float: right" width="200">Mind 
	Flayers<a name="2-Extinct-Races"></a></h2>
	<p>The mind flayers (or <strong>illithids</strong>), are the most powerful 
	race on this world.&nbsp; They are insidious, diabolical, and powerful, and 
	are feared by all other races.&nbsp; They bend others to their will and 
	shatter their enemies minds.&nbsp; Their control of this world was once 
	absolute, and even now they are the undisputed masters of the Lowerworld as 
	well as vast swaths of the Middleworld and Upperworld and portions of the 
	surface. </p>
	<p>Mind flayers are highly intelligent, wholly evil, and terribly sadistic.&nbsp; 
	They wield enormous psionic and magical powers, and they command a vast army 
	of slaves, many of whom have been bred specifically to serve the illithids.</p>
	<p>A typical mind flayer is a
	<a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/psionics-unleashed/classes/psion"><strong>
	psion</strong></a> (usually a
	<a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/psionics-unleashed/classes/psion/psionic-disciplines/telepathy">
	telepath</a> or
	<a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/psionics-unleashed/classes/psion/psionic-disciplines/clairsentience">
	seer</a>) of at least 11th level, though illithid wizards and sorcerers are 
	not uncommon.&nbsp; Though their tactics vary, illithids favor the use of
	<strong>domination spells</strong> and other mind-affecting attacks.&nbsp; 
	They also have a<strong> mind blast</strong> power that stuns nearby 
	creatures.&nbsp; A mind flayer that successfully grabs a victim can use its 
	mouth tentacles to<strong> split open the skull and extract the brain</strong>.</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="Grimlocks" class="auto-style1" height="360" src="Grimlocks.jpg" style="float: left" width="150">Mind 
	flayers command many different kinds of monsters, too numerous to list.&nbsp; 
	In the most recent war, the bulk of their armies consisted of <strong>
	grimlocks</strong>.&nbsp; These monstrous humanoids appear to have been bred 
	by the mind flayers, who removed their eyes and gave them the power of
	<strong>
	<a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Blindsight-Ex-">
	blindsight</a></strong>.&nbsp; Mind flayers often use this power to their 
	advantage, and grimlock armies often attack under the cover of magical 
	darkness or obscuring mists.&nbsp; Grimlock blindsight is based on hearing 
	and scent, and grimlocks can be &quot;blinded&quot; by negating these two senses.</p>
	<p>Other common mind-flayer slaves include<strong> ogres</strong> and<strong> 
	trolls</strong>, specifically bred for war and equipped with heavy weapons 
	and armor.&nbsp; Mind flayers also command many different kinds of <strong>
	aberrations</strong>, some of which may have been bred by the illithids, and 
	some of which may have been captured by them in the <strong>far realm</strong> 
	(an alien dimension of pure madness that the mind flayers have access to).&nbsp; 
	Mind flayers are accomplished at<strong> teleportation</strong> and<strong> 
	plane shifting</strong>, and they will often teleport their minions directly 
	onto a battlefield.</p>
	<p>Mind flayers are enemies with virtually all sentient creatures, including 
	the duergar, svirfneblin, and drow.&nbsp; They are also the sworn enemies of 
	the <strong>githzerai </strong>and <strong>githyanki </strong>races, both of 
	whom live primarily in the <strong>Astral Plane </strong>and various <strong>
	outer planes</strong>.&nbsp; The two gith races share a common ancestry and 
	a hatred for the mind flayers, though they otherwise have very different 
	outlooks.&nbsp; (The githyanki are fierce and evil, while the githzerai are 
	stoic and neutral.)</p>
	<p>At least twice in the past the illithids constructed psionic artifacts 
	known as a<strong> thoughtstones</strong>, which could be used to enslave 
	all sentient beings on a single plane of existence. Each of the two 
	thoughtstones had the shape of a gigantic psionic crystal hundreds of feet 
	tall, fashioned through some unknown means, and mounted in a huge machine 
	designed to amplify and focus its psionic power.&nbsp; Both thoughtstones 
	were destroyed physically, the first by a small force of githyanki that 
	managed to turn the machine's power in on itself, and the second as part of 
	a major battle in the middle of the <strong>Devastation War</strong>.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>The mind flayers also built 
	a giant machine known as the <strong>Vatholaunt</strong>, a device which was capable of destroying 
	underground cities by generating massive earthquakes.&nbsp; This device also 
	somehow temporarily drained magic from this plane of existence, making it 
	impossible to use magic items or cast arcane or divine spells for a period 
	of time after its use.&nbsp; They used the Vatholaunt to great effect 
	shortly after the start of the Devastation War, but the machine was ruined 
	by an elite unit of dwarves dispatched from Gracklstugh.</p>

	<p>
	<img class="auto-style1" height="206" src="Gibberlings.jpg" style="float: left" width="150"><strong><a name="Gibberlings"></a>Gibberlings</strong> 
	are the unstoppable army ants of this world.&nbsp; They rampage through the 
	darkness in shrieking mobs, consuming any creature that fails to get out of 
	their way.&nbsp; An individual gibberling is a grotesque humanoid about 3 
	feet tall, with a bestial face and sharp fangs, but gibberlings are usually encountered in groups of <strong>at 
	least a thousand</strong>, and they function more as a single wave than as 
	individual creatures.&nbsp; Victims of a gibberling horde are crushed by the 
	pandemonium, and are subsequently torn limb from 
	limb and eaten.&nbsp; Gibberlings are adept at both swimming and climbing, 
	but <strong>bright light</strong> will slow their advance, and they tend to 
	be <strong>frightened by fire</strong>.</p>
	<p>
	<a name="Kuo-Toa"></a>
	<img height="237" src="Kuo-Toa.jpg" style="float: right" width="150"><strong>Kuo-toa</strong> 
	are evil fish-like humanoids with an alien appearance and psyche.&nbsp; They 
	populate many underground lakes and oceans of the world, and what ancient 
	horrors they consort with in the deepest chasms of the world are better left 
	unknown.&nbsp; Their society seems to be organized into the worship of a 
	being called the <strong>&quot;Sea Mother&quot;</strong>, whose nature is a mystery.&nbsp; 
	Clerics of the sea mother are called <strong>whips</strong>, and groups of 
	whips can shoot lightning from their pincer staffs.&nbsp; Kuo-toa warriors 
	are often monks known as <strong>monitors</strong>.</p>
	<p>
	<img class="auto-style1" height="192" src="Beholder.jpg" style="float: left" width="200"><strong><a name="Beholders"></a>Beholders</strong>, 
	also known as <strong>eye tyrants</strong>, are common in unexplored regions 
	and in the Lowerworld.&nbsp; There the beholders congregate into large 
	cities such as Ootul (the City of Tyrants) and Xonox (under the Lake of 
	Steam), each home to hundreds of beholders and their slaves.&nbsp; 
	Beholders tend to be hostile to all other races, whom they perceive as 
	inferior. In combat, beholders emit an <strong>anti-magic field</strong> 
	from their central eye, and their remaining eyes shoot a variety of rays 
	with effects such as <strong>disintegration</strong>, <strong>petrification</strong>, 
	and <strong>death</strong>.</p>
	<p>
	<img height="214" src="quaggoth.jpg" style="float: right" width="200"><strong><a name="Quaggoths"></a>Quaggoths</strong> 
	are a race of evil <strong>bear-like</strong> humanoids that live in 
	primitive nomadic communities that raid and forage for food.&nbsp; They are 
	also commonly used as slaves by the more advanced races, including duergar, 
	drow, and illithids.&nbsp; In combat, quaggoths typically fly into a <strong>
	feral rage</strong> and fight to the death, though quaggoth tribes sometimes 
	do include a shaman, skald, or witch. Ruins have been found north of 
	Menzoberranzan indicating that the quaggoths once had a civilization in that 
	region, but the city there seems to have been destroyed some time before the 
	awakening, possibly by the mind flayers.</p>
	<p>
	<img class="auto-style1" height="185" src="grell.jpg" style="float: left" width="120"><strong><a name="Grell"></a>Grell</strong>, 
	also known as<strong> eaters</strong>,<strong> </strong>are a bizarre race 
	of aberrations that seek to devour all other sentient creatures in the 
	world.&nbsp; Grell congregate in large colonies or nests in which they 
	practice <strong>bizarre forms of magic</strong> and organize hunting 
	parties.&nbsp; Their colonies often contain many strange crystal structures 
	of unknown purpose, and their civilization is completely alien to all 
	outsiders.&nbsp; In combat, grell attack with their tentacles, which they 
	use to <strong>paralyze</strong> their prey before devouring them.&nbsp; 
	Some grell also wield strange magical or alchemical weapons, usually 
	involving <strong>electrical</strong> or <strong>sonic</strong> attacks.</p>
	<p>
	<img height="209" src="Mite.jpg" style="float: right" width="150"><strong><a name="Mites"></a>Mites
	</strong>are a hideously ugly race of blue fey that live in small colonies 
	throughout the Middleworld and Upperworld.&nbsp; They are pitiful and 
	craven, frightened even of goblins, but they sometimes attack travelers out 
	of hatred and spite.&nbsp; Mites have a natural empathy with <strong>vermin</strong>, 
	and they often raise giant centipedes, spiders, and cave fishers for use in 
	combat.&nbsp; Mites make poor slaves and most other races treat them as 
	pests to be exterminated.</p>
	<p>
	<img class="auto-style1" height="173" src="Cloaker.jpg" style="float: left" width="150"><strong><a name="Cloakers"></a>Cloakers</strong> 
	are a mysterious race of hideously evil flying manta rays that can be found 
	in secret places throughout the world. They communicate through unnerving
	<strong>infrasonic moans</strong> that can cause fear, nausea, and 
	unconsciousness in humanoids.&nbsp; Cloakers are also skilled at the <strong>
	manipulation of shadows</strong>, which they can use to produce various 
	spell-like effects.&nbsp; There have been reports of<strong> cloaker cities</strong> 
	in remote corners<strong> </strong>in the world, though few who have seen 
	these cities have lived to tell the tale.</p>
	<p>
	<img height="198" src="Fomorian.jpg" style="float: right" width="150"><strong><a name="Fomorians"></a>Fomorians</strong> 
	are the most grotesque and wicked of all giants.&nbsp; They dwell in 
	scattered tribes throughout the world, though they are most often found in 
	the Middleworld.&nbsp; They <strong>eat humanoid creatures</strong>, and for 
	this reason they are feared and loathed by nearly all other races.&nbsp; All 
	fomorians are deformed in a variety of ways, and some have speculated that 
	the creatures live in constant pain.&nbsp; Fomorians have an <strong>
	excellent sense of smell</strong>, and are difficult to surprise.&nbsp; They 
	also <strong>heal wounds quickly</strong>, though they do not regenerate 
	like trolls.</p>
	<p>
	<img class="auto-style1" height="202" src="DarkOnes.jpg" style="float: left" width="150"><strong><a name="Dark Ones"></a>Dark 
	ones </strong>are a loathsome race that creep through all of the darkest 
	places of the world.&nbsp; They live in strange villages of stone and fungus
	<strong>shrouded in magical darkness</strong>, and they prey on unwary 
	travelers and nearby settlements.&nbsp; Their true nature is mysterious, for 
	they shroud themselves in layer upon layer of filthy rags, and the creatures
	<strong>explode like a fireball</strong> when killed.&nbsp; They <strong>
	dislike bright lights</strong>, and can sometimes be driven away by the 
	flash of a lightning bolt or a well-placed light spell.</p>
	<p>
	<img height="171" src="Aboleth.png" style="float: right" width="150"><strong><a name="Aboleths"></a>Aboleths</strong> 
	are a race of ancient beings that live in the deepest underground seas of 
	the Lowerworld.&nbsp; They dwell in grotesque <strong>underwater cities</strong> 
	built in nauseating and cyclopean styles, where they worship the <strong>
	Elder Evils</strong> such as Y'chak and plot the enslavement and destruction 
	of all other forms of life.&nbsp; Even the mind flayers consider them a 
	threat, for they were largely responsible for the <strong>Far Realm Invasion</strong> 
	of the second century post-awakening, which forced the mind flayers and the 
	other races into an uneasy alliance against beings invading from a dimension 
	of pure madness.&nbsp; In combat, aboleths confuse their enemies with 
	illusions and use their natural <strong>domination</strong> ability to 
	control their foes.</p>
	<p>
	<img class="auto-style1" height="236" src="Gug.jpg" style="float: left" width="175"><strong><a name="Gugs"></a>Gugs</strong> 
	are giant monstrosities common in the Lowerworld.&nbsp; Though their 
	behavior is often bestial, they are actually quite intelligent, and they 
	worship mad gods that encourage them to perform carnal rites of slaughter. 
	They <strong>eat other creatures</strong>, including humanoids, aberrations, 
	and the ghouls common in the Lowerworld, and they seem to delight in mayhem 
	and carnage.&nbsp; Some gugs have terrible spell-like abilities, and gug 
	leaders are sometimes clerics or oracles of their insane gods.</p>
	<p>
	<img height="197" src="PurpleWorm.jpg" style="float: right" width="200"><strong><a name="Purple Worms"></a>Purple 
	worms </strong>are common throughout all parts of the world.&nbsp; Indeed, it 
	is thought that these creatures are responsible for many of the tunnels that 
	can be found in less populated regions.&nbsp; A typical worm is <strong>80 
	feet long</strong> and 5 feet wide, though much larger specimens have been 
	reported.&nbsp; They are always hungry, and many unwary travelers have been 
	surprised by a worm suddenly bursting through the rock looking for food.&nbsp; 
	Purple worms also have a <strong>poison stinger </strong>on their tail, and 
	their sting causes weakness and eventually paralysis.&nbsp; Purple worms 
	often swallow a large number of <strong>gems</strong> in their burrowing, 
	and those brave enough to kill a worm often find quite a treasure in its 
	gullet.</p>
	<p>
	<img class="auto-style1" height="221" src="Derro.jpg" style="float: left" width="150"><strong><a name="Derro"></a>Derro</strong> 
	are one of the most common races found throughout the world.&nbsp; Sadistic 
	and insane, derro prey on travelers as well as those who live on the 
	outskirts of civilized communities. They perform <strong>hideous experiments</strong> 
	and surgeries on their victims, and being a prisoner of the derro is 
	generally considered a fate worse than death.&nbsp; They can<strong> turn 
	invisible</strong>, and they have been known to use this power to sneak into 
	large settlements and cities to kidnap sleeping victims or even just 
	experiment on those who are sleeping.&nbsp; Derro use a variety of <strong>
	bizarre weapons</strong> and devices in combat, as well as their significant
	<strong>psychic abilities</strong>, and they often have other monsters at 
	their disposal such as<strong> gargoyles </strong>and<strong> lamias</strong>, 
	as well as slaves and monstrosities created by their twisted experiments.&nbsp; 
	Derro madness is caused by their consumption of <strong>brain mold fungus</strong> 
	(cytillesh), and derro who manage to break their addiction to this fungus 
	become much more peaceful and reasonable.&nbsp; Many such derro have 
	established communities in dwarf cities, though they are often despised and 
	mistrusted by the duergar.</p>
	<p>
	<img class="auto-style3" height="271" src="FireGiant.jpg" style="float: right" width="200"><strong><a name="Fire Giants"></a>Fire 
	giants</strong> are common in the Middleworld, especially in areas of 
	volcanic activity.&nbsp; <strong>Militaristic and brutal</strong>, fire 
	giant conquests are frustrated only by their inability to tolerate &quot;cold&quot; 
	temperatures for long stretches.&nbsp; Unlike the barbarous fomorians or 
	lesser giants such as stone giants or hill giants, fire giants live in a 
	rigid society organized into kingdoms, and though they <strong>delight in 
	battle and carnage</strong>, they are possible to reason with or even bribe.&nbsp; 
	Their smithing is more renowned than even that of the dwarves, for unlike 
	dwarves they do not need to rely on tools to shape hot metal.&nbsp; In 
	combat they mostly rely on their martial prowess, though clerics and other 
	spellcasters are not uncommon.&nbsp; All fire giants worship <strong>Surtur</strong>, 
	their tyrannical god.</p>

	<img class="auto-style1" height="188" src="roper.jpg" style="float: left" width="150"><strong><a name="Ropers"></a>Ropers

	To an unwary traveler, a roper will often appear to be a simple stalagmite 
	until it begins to shoot out <strong>strands</strong>.&nbsp; These strands 
	grab prey and deliver a toxin that causes <strong>weakness and paralysis</strong>.&nbsp; 
	Though they may seem to be simple monsters, ropers are actually quite 
	intelligent, and after their prey are subdued they often enjoy conversing 
	with them on matters of religion and the <strong>philosophy of life and 
	death</strong>.</p>

	<img height="210" src="Ixzan.jpg" style="float: right" width="150"><a name="Ixzan"></a><strong>Ixzan</strong>, 
	also known as <strong>devilfish</strong>, are a race of ray-like creatures 
	that live in many underground lakes.&nbsp; They are disliked by the major 
	races for their rapacious lifestyle, their aggression, and their habit of 
	enslaving captives.&nbsp; With the help of their slaves they construct 
	strange pyramids under the water, which are important in the worship of 
	their god <strong>Ilxenden</strong>.&nbsp; Ixzan leaders are often <strong>
	vampire clerics</strong>, and even ordinary Ixzans have an array of magical 
	abilities, in addition to their poisonous tail stings.</p>

	<img class="auto-style1" height="209" src="GibberingMouther.jpg" style="float: left" width="150"><a name="GibberingMouther"></a>Gibbering 
	mouthers</strong> are a disgusting race of aberrations that wander remote 
	tunnels in search of blood.&nbsp; Their bizarre gibbering sows <strong>
	confusion</strong> in their victims, and they can also spit a <strong>
	blinding acid</strong>.&nbsp; Once a mouther's foes are neutralized in this 
	fashion, the creature will latch onto its victims with mouthed tentacles and<strong> 
	drain blood</strong>.<strong> </strong>Gibbering mouthers only attack 
	intelligent creatures, and some scholars speculate that in addition to 
	feeding on blood the mouthers can somehow consume the sanity of sentient 
	creatures.&nbsp; Though they are reviled by almost all living beings, 
	gibbering mouthers are sometimes kept as pets by the derro.</p>

	and <strong>nightcrawlers </strong>are two different forms of <strong>
	nightshade</strong> that can sometimes be found in the Lowerworld.&nbsp; 
	Nightskitters have the form of terrible <strong>spider creatures </strong>
	shrouded in darkness, while nightcrawlers take the form of <strong>immense 
	worms</strong> covered in jet-black, chitinous armor.&nbsp; Nightshades are 
	actually <strong>undead </strong>in the sense that they are negative-energy 
	creatures, but unlike most undead they represent neither the corporeal nor 
	spiritual remains of a once-living creature.&nbsp; Instead, nightshades are 
	powerful necrotic ambominations formed directly from darkness and ineffible 
	evil.&nbsp; Scholars have speculated that nightshades may originate from the 
	deepest voids at the planar juncture of the Plane of Shadow and the Negative 
	Energy Plane, where reality itself ends. </p>

	<img class="auto-style1" height="169" src="Tsathogga.png" style="float: left" width="300"><strong><a name="Tsathogga"></a>Tsathogga</strong>, 
	also known as <strong>the Frog God</strong>, is a foul demon-lord with the 
	shape of a gigantic frog.&nbsp; He is the viscous dark evil bubbling up from

	worshipped by the <strong>tsathar</strong>, an obscure race of evil frog 
	people that can be found in a few parts of the Middleworld, as well various 
	other cultists known as the <strong>Lords of the Gaping Maw</strong>.&nbsp; 
	Tsathogga cares less about machinations and gaining power than he does about 
	obliterating light and life with the slow oozing sickness and decay that he 
	represents. There are rumors that Tsathogga can sometimes be found swimming 
	in the black waters of the Darklake, but there have been no confirmed 
	sightings of the demon-lord.&nbsp; Note that <strong>several other 
	demon-lords are also known to live on this plane</strong>, so the presence 
	of Tsathogga on this plane is in some sense not particularly alarming.</p>

	<h2><a name="3-Races"></a>3. The Main Races</h2>
	<h3><a name="Drow"></a>A. Drow</h3>
	<p><img height="294" src="Drow.jpg" style="float: right" width="150">Drow 
	are the evil race of elves that live in this world.&nbsp; They are tall and 
	lanky, with obsidian skin and white hair, and females tend to be slightly 
	larger than males.&nbsp; Their society is <strong>matriarchal</strong> and 
	rigidly controlled by the <strong>priesthood of Lolth</strong>.&nbsp; Female 
	drow are most often clerics, while the males are usually fighters or 
	wizards.</p>
	<p>Most drow are cruel, arrogant, and hedonistic. Their eternal game of 
	advancement at the expense of others, which is encouraged by Lolth herself, 
	has fashioned the drow into a race of scheming backstabbers eager to 
	increase their own stations by pulling down those ahead of them and crushing 
	their inferiors underfoot. Drow trust no one and nothing, and most are 
	incapable of compassion, kindness, or love. Many drow are actively murderous 
	and delight in the giving of pain.</p>
	<p>
	<img class="auto-style1" height="322" src="Lolth.jpg" style="float: left" width="250">Drow 
	worship <strong>Lolth</strong>, known as the <strong>Demon Queen of Spiders</strong>.&nbsp; 
	Originally a demon lord, Lolth ascended to godhood, and has since become one 
	of the most powerful of all gods. Lolth's church promotes the superiority of 
	the Queen of Spiders over all other beings. In most cities, her clerics 
	control the noble houses and thus the cities themselves. Her clerics act as 
	the rulers, police force, judges, juries, and executioners of their society.&nbsp; 
	Drow are extremely loyal to Lolth, whom they often refer to as the <strong>
	Queen Mother</strong>, and drow regard themselves as <strong>children of 
	Lolth</strong>.</p>
	<p>Most drow cities occupy large vaults or caverns in the Middleworld, and 
	overall the drow are probably the most powerful race in the Middleworld.&nbsp; 
	Their cities and strongholds are numerous, wealthy, and well situated for 
	defense, and the drow themselves are cruel and strong. Only the endless 
	feuding of the great Houses constrains drow power. The most famous (and 
	closest) drow city is <strong>Menzoberranzan</strong>, known as the <strong>
	city of spiders</strong>.</p>
	<p>Groups of noble drow often form <strong>hunting parties</strong> for 
	entertainment, with important nobles and wizards riding on giant hunting 
	spiders.&nbsp; The quarry for such a party may be a particular type of 
	monster, or perhaps a group of slaves released into the tunnels with some 
	kind of head-start.&nbsp; Any non-drow encountered by a hunting party are 
	enslaved or killed.&nbsp; Though drow view all other races as inferior, they 
	recognize the strength of the dwarves, and groups of drow will rarely attack 
	or enslave parties of duergar.</p>
	<p><img height="256" src="Drider.jpg" style="float: right" width="250">Those 
	drow who lose the favor of Lolth are often transformed into <strong>driders</strong> 
	as punishment.&nbsp; A drider has the head and torso of a drow, but the 
	abdomen and legs of a giant spider.&nbsp; Driders can be found in slums 
	surrounding drow cities, but some driders have also established independent 
	settlements.</p>
	<p>In combat, drow make liberal use of <strong>poison</strong>.&nbsp; They 
	use a special poison that causes <strong>unconsciousness</strong>, which 
	makes it easy for them to enslave fallen foes.&nbsp; They favor ambush and stealth 
	techniques, and they often attack under the cover of magical <strong>
	darkness</strong>.&nbsp; Drow often have many slaves and monsters at their 
	command, especially <strong>giant spiders</strong> and various spider 
	creatures, as well as <strong>draegloths</strong> and other demons.</p>
	<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
	<h3><a name="Duergar"></a>B. Duergar</h3>
	<p><img height="290" src="Duergar.jpg" style="float: right" width="200">Duergar 
	are the evil race of dwarves that live in this world.&nbsp; Duergar lead 
	lives of <strong>never-ending toil </strong>in the great foundry-cities they 
	have built in the Middleworld.&nbsp; Dwarves are nearly as widespread and 
	numerous as the drow, and the typical duergar realm is every bit as strong, 
	cruel, and wealthy as a great city of the elves. But while most drow cities 
	exist to exalt the high nobility of elves, duergar cities exist only for the 
	manufacture of wealth through unending labor.</p>
	<p>Duergar are sullen, insular, and industrious, but they tend to be better 
	neighbors than drow and are less likely to raid nearby settlements or seek 
	out victims to torment. They are the preeminent artisans and merchants of 
	the world, and duergar caravans cross every corner of Middleworld.&nbsp; 
	Dwarves are all too willing to <strong>enslave</strong> any likely creatures 
	that fall into their hands, but they don't waste slaves in the sort of cruel 
	spectacles that the drow enjoy. Instead, the duergar simply <strong>work 
	their captives to death</strong>.</p>
	<p>The patron deity of the duergar is <strong>Laduguer</strong>, the dwarven 
	deity of toil. Duergar spend little time or effort on any sort of religious 
	observances because they feel that the best way to venerate their grim god 
	is to work.</p>
	<p>Duergar cities are less numerous than those of the drow, but any given 
	dwarf city is likely to be a strong, wealthy, and martially inclined realm 
	quite powerful enough to deter the attacks of its hostile neighbors.&nbsp; 
	The nearest dwarf city is <strong>Gracklstugh</strong>, known as the <strong>
	City of Blades</strong>, which lies on the south end of the Darklake.&nbsp; 
	Gracklstugh is the seat of the <strong>Deep Kingdom</strong> and is ruled by 
	the Deepking, currently Horgar Steelshadow IV.&nbsp; In addition to the 
	Stoneguard (the king's royal guard), the dwarf army, and the Wyrmsmith (an 
	adult red dragon), the king commands a legion of<strong> stone giants</strong> 
	who live in the Cairngorm cavern, as well as the derro who live in Laduger's 
	furrow.</p>
	<p>In combat, duergar take a straightforward martial approach, though their 
	discipline and grim determination make them formidable combatants.&nbsp;
	<strong>Clerics and psions</strong> are common among the duergar, and they 
	are adept at using psionics and magic to enhance and complement their 
	armies.&nbsp; During times of war, the duergar have also been known to 
	summon large numbers of devils and other fiends to do their bidding.</p>
	<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
	<h3><a name="Svirfneblin"></a>C. Svirfneblin</h3>
	<p><img height="205" src="Svirfneblin.png" style="float: right" width="120">The 
	svirfneblin are the race of gnomes that live in this world.&nbsp; Silent and 
	wary, the svirfneblin dwell in <strong>secret mines and caverns</strong> throughout the 
	Middleworld.&nbsp; Svirfneblin are suspicious and serious creatures, and 
	they keep their holdings hidden from other races because only caution, 
	stealth, and cooperation with others of their kind stand between the 
	svirfneblin and a terrible end.</p>
	<p>Svirfneblin are master <strong>artisans, miners, and gemcutters</strong>. Their handiwork 
	is prized throughout the world, and the boldest svirfneblin are welcomed as 
	neutral merchants among many races. They make superior guides, scouts, and 
	foragers because they often know passages and portals long lost to other 
	races, and few can match the stealth or cunning of svirfneblin rangers 
	watching over their own territory.</p>
	<p>Svirfneblin are suspicious and slow to give their trust. They have little 
	desire to meet new people, so most svirfneblin appear <strong>grim, sullen, and 
	pessimistic</strong> to others.&nbsp; Svirfneblin admire well-wrought metalwork and 
	weapons, but they love the beauty of gemstones with a passion that seems 
	impossible for creatures with such dour personalities. They are diligent, 
	industrious, and tireless in the pursuit of excellence.</p>

	<h2><a name="4-Elemental-Weirds"></a>4. Elemental Weirds</h2>
	<p>
	<img class="auto-style1" height="232" src="FourElements.jpg" style="float: right" width="236">The 
	elemental weirds are four cryptic beings of elemental force who are powerful 
	in the art of divination.&nbsp; Though they live on the elemental planes, 
	two of the weirds have traveled to this plane at several key points in 
	history to deliver <strong>prophecies</strong> and share their <strong>
	knowledge</strong> of past, present, and future.</p>
	<p>Each of the weirds can divine information that could change the very 
	course of history. Through their deep connection to the primal forces of 
	nature, each weird has an intuitive sense of fate and can discern <strong>
	truths unknown even to the gods</strong>.&nbsp; Like most seers, the 
	elemental weirds never provide clear, concise prophecies. Some of the 
	message may seem forthright, but some is always confusing or just difficult 
	to decipher because the listener does not have enough information to 
	understand the weird's meaning. Though its messages can be misinterpreted, a 
	weird's warnings and advice are <strong>never wrong</strong>.</p>
	<p>Though there are presumably four weirds (one for each element), it 
	appears that only the <strong>Air and Fire Weirds</strong> have played an 
	important role in history, and only those two have ever visited this plane.&nbsp; 
	The <strong>Earth Weird</strong> has been encountered on the Elemental Plane 
	of Earth, but it does not seem to concern itself with this plane, and its 
	prophecies have been described as &quot;hopelessly cryptic and muddled&quot;. As far 
	as can be determined, the <strong>Water Weird</strong> has never been found, 
	and perhaps no longer exists.</p>
	<p>The true extent of the weirds' influence is unknown, and their prophecies 
	have been shared only with a select few.&nbsp; The sage Rogaron, psionic 
	adviser to King Kragspear&nbsp;II, claimed that prophecies of the Air Weird were 
	instrumental during the <strong>Devastation War</strong>, and that without 
	the influence of the weirds the mind flayers would have easily regained 
	control of this entire plane.</p>

	<h2><a name="5-Time-Travel"></a>5. Time Travel</h2>
	<p>
	<img class="auto-style2" height="247" src="TimeTravel.jpg" style="float: right" width="175">There 
	are very few references to actual time travel in the library.&nbsp; Here is 
	what you could find:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A legendary artifact known as the <strong>Scepter of Ages</strong> 
		is said to allow the wielder to travel in time.&nbsp; It is unclear 
		whether scepter actually exists or is simply a legend fostered by 
		speculation among sages.&nbsp; It is said the scepter obeys laws 
		beyond those of this reality, and it is thought that its origin must be 
		extradimensional.</li>
		<li>The <strong>time dragons</strong> are widely regarded to be the most 
		powerful of the outer dragons (dragons that can only be found on the 
		outer planes). Watchers and waiters, time dragons guard the universe 
		against those that would interfere with the natural temporal order. Some 
		sources claim that time dragons can themselves travel through time, but 
		this may be idle speculation.</li>
		<li><strong>Bythos</strong> are a type of aeon who serve as guardians of 
		time and planar travel. (The aeons are a class of neutral outsiders&nbsp;who 
		roam the planes maintaining the balance of reality.) Bythos seek out 
		abuses of planar travel, such as tears in reality, regions where planes 
		overlap, or creatures that abuse the use of planar travel. </li>
		<li>Some travelers who have encountered <strong>cloakers</strong> have 
		reported abnormalities in the flow of time, especially in the vicinity 
		of cloaker cities.&nbsp; This has led some sages to speculate that these 
		strange beings somehow live outside of the normal flow of time.<strong>
		</strong></li>
		<li>Most scholars believe that <strong>wormholes in the astral plane
		</strong>can be used to move creatures through both space and time, yet 
		the powerful magic required to avoid being crushed, turned into 
		molecule-thin threads of matter, and slowed in relative time by the 
		tidal forces involved make this a difficult means of travel for most 
		mortals.</li>
		<li>&nbsp;Various spellcasters seem to have the ability to control the 
		flow of time, e.g. the <strong>time hop</strong> psionic power or the
		<strong>time stop</strong> spell.&nbsp; Perhaps the spellcasters with 
		the strongest ability to control the flow of time are <strong>oracles of 
		time</strong>.</li>

	<h2><a name="6-Elemental-Plane-of-Earth"></a>6. Elemental Plane of Earth</h2>
	<p>
	<img class="auto-style1" height="267" src="PlaneOfEarth.jpg" style="float: right" width="200">The 
	Elemental Plane of Earth is a solid place made of rock, soil, and stone. The 
	unwary and unprepared traveler may find himself entombed within this vast 
	solidity of material and have his life crushed into nothingness, his 
	powdered remains a warning to any foolish enough to follow.</p>
	<p>Despite its solid, unyielding nature, the Elemental Plane of Earth is 
	varied in its consistency, ranging from relatively soft soil to veins of 
	heavier and more valuable metal. Striations of granite, volcanic rock, and 
	marble interweave with brittle crystal and soft, crumbling chalks and 
	sandstones. Thin <strong>veins of gemstones</strong>, rough and huge, can be 
	found within the plane, and these unpolished jewels often lead the greedy to 
	this plane in the hopes of picking them up with minimal effort. Such 
	prospectors often meet their match in the natives of the Elemental Plane of 
	Earth, who feel extremely attached (sometimes literally) to parts of their 
	home.</p>
	<p><strong>Earth elementals</strong> are sentient parts of the plane itself. 
	They move effortlessly through the mix of rock and soil that makes up the 
	Elemental Plane of Earth.&nbsp; Earth elementals are spontaneously generated 
	from the material of the plane itself rather than being &quot;born&quot; in a more 
	traditional sense. If slain on its home plane, an earth elemental returns to 
	its basic, unthinking elemental nature.&nbsp; Other inhabitants of the 
	Elemental Plane of Earth include <strong>xorns</strong>, <strong>earth 
	mephits, crysmals, sandmen, gargoyles, mudlords, pechs, thoqquas</strong>, 
	and <strong>blue and copper dragons</strong>.</p>
	<p>The most civilized race on the Elemental plane of Earth is the <strong>
	dao</strong>. These <strong>evil genies </strong>are found in a number of 
	communities and are often at odds with the native elemental life because the 
	dao continually desire to deal with extraplanar races. The greatest of the 
	dao communities is the <strong>Great Dismal Delve</strong>, also known as 
	the Great Mazework.&nbsp; This is a maddening maze of passages, memorized by 
	the dao but confusing to the traveler. The dao and their slave races live 
	here in dark splendor, eagerly mining gems for trade. Slaves, often the 
	losers in bets and bargains made with the dao, build and rebuild passages, 
	fend off elemental attacks, and are otherwise slowly worked to death by 
	their uncaring masters.</p>
