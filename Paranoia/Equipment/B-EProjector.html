<h1>B-E Projector</h1>

<p>For a number of years now, work has been proceeding in order to bring perfection to the crudely conceived idea of a field weapon capable of projecting an aerosol of Bose-Einstein condensate over a wide dispersal area as a general anti-personnel measure and emergency refrigeration device.  The principle is that B-E transmission could be accomplished not only by supplying inverse reactive current for use in unilateral phase detractors, but also through the simultaneous automatic synchronization of cardinal grammeters. Such an instrument is the B-E projector.</p>

<p>Now basically the only new principle involved is that instead of power being generated by the relative motion of conductors and fluxes, it is produced by the modial interaction of magneto-reluctance and capacitive diractance.</p>

<p>The original machine had a base plate of pre-famulated amulite surmounted by a malleable logarithmic casing in such a way that the two spurving bearings were in a direct line with the panametric fan. The latter consisted simply of six hydrocoptic marzlevanes, so fitted to the ambifacient lunar waneshaft that side fumbling was effectively prevented.  Of course, this occasionally leads to a loss of condensate pressure due to quantum tunnelling cascade events, but manual repressurization using a forescent skor motion in combination with an internal drawn reciprocation dingle arm should be sufficient to reduce sinusoidal repleneration in combat situations.</p>

<p>The main winding was of the normal lotus-o-delta type placed in panendermic semi-boloid slots of the stator, every seventh conductor being connected by a non-reversible tremie pipe to the differential girdle spring on the “up” end of the grammeters.</p>

<p>The B-E projector has now reached a high level of development, and it’s being successfully used internally for experimental development that requires the operation of novertrunnions. Externally, the B-E projector has been approved for field testing by Troubleshooter teams whose mission parameters predict a sufficient surplus of clone backups to test the weapon effectively.</p>
