<h2>Your Background</h2>

<p>You never planned to be a thief. You were just being careful. Losing equipment is treason, so if you can't remember whether something is yours, you'd better take it, right? And if it doesn't belong to you, you could always sell it on the <span class="tooltip">IR&nbsp;market<span class="tooltiptext"><b>INFRARED markets</b> are illegal bazaars run by Free Enterprise in many sectors.</span></span> for a few extra creds. But you got caught wiggling through a ventilation shaft, and only a bit of fast-talking got you out with your clone life intact.</p>

<p>Now you're a registered mutant and The Computer has its eye on you. But you also caught the eye of Free Enterprise (which is basically the Alpha Complex equivalent of the mob).  They arranged for you to get assigned to the Troubleshooters, and if you play your cards right you should have a big career ahead of you in merchandise resale.</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>Your Snuf-N-Truder supervisor tells you, &lsquo;There's been a rash of fires in several adjacent sectors.  Analysis of the fire damage indicates substandard fire protection; only 43% of the affected areas had functional smoke detectors, in outright violation of Qwalitie Standard 5598217HP/#30! Outrageous!

<h2>Secret Society #1</h2>

<p><b>Society:</b> <span class="tooltipbottom">Free Enterprise<span class="tooltiptext">
<b>Beliefs of Free Enterprise</b><br><br>

Free markets are good. Getting rich
is good. If there’s a demand for a good or
service, and The Computer doesn’t meet it,
well, someone’s got to. If we get rich in the
process, that’s great. Serve the Law of Supply
and Demand. Give citizens what they want
(and The Computer won’t) and they will make
you wealthy. The Computer’s gotten wise to a
lot of our scams, but there’s plenty of suckers
out there still.
</span></span></p>

<p><b>Recognition Signal:</b> ‘How’s business?’ with the reply, ‘Nobody pays retail any more.’</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<p>Your Free Enterprise contact tells you, &lsquo;This is your big chance.  Troubleshooters get access to all sorts of valuable weapons and equipment, and we've arranged for you to be appointed Equipment Officer for your team.  Just let us know what you have access to and we can find a buyer on the <span class="tooltip">IR&nbsp;market<span class="tooltiptext"><b>INFRARED markets</b> are illegal bazaars run by Free Enterprise in many sectors.</span></span>, with Free Enterprise taking a cut, of course.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Also, we've heard that a new drug is about to hit the market.

It is full of horrid perils such as tornadoes, lightning bolts, giant screeching boulders,

Here's a few samples, so you can see what it looks like, and maybe get an early start on finding some buyers. Get hold of as much of the stuff as you can; destroy the rest to boost the market price.&rsquo;</p>

<p><b>Regarding Your Mission</b>:This new baby’s probably got a thousand useful items built right in. Obtain
something valuable from the Mark&nbsp;4, preferably mass-marketish. But don’t harm Mark&nbsp;4; it does
a good job keeping the Commies in check.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Secret Society #2</h2>

<p><b>Society:</b> <span class="tooltipbottom">Pro Tech<span class="tooltiptext">
<meta charset="UTF-8"/>
<b>Beliefs of Pro Tech</b><br><br>

Encouraging research and the
development of new technologies will let
humanity restore the Earth’s ruined surface
and return to the stars beyond. Better gadgets
solve all problems. In recent centuries the
bureaucracy has completely stifled research
and design. We must emerge from the Dark
Age and into the light of the Machine Age.
Bots and computers can transform the world
into a playground, giving humanity unlimited
leisure.
</span></span></p>

<p><b>Your Implant:</b> As a member of Pro Tech, you have a small subcutaneous implant that will vibrate whenever it's within 10 feet of another Pro Tech member.</p>

<p><b>Your Codename:</b> You're well-known within Pro Tech under the codename &ldquo;Kermit&rdquo;.</p>


<h3>Instructions</h3>

<p>Your Pro Tech contact tells you, &lsquo;We're testing out a new bot personality mod that'll really drag Alpha Complex into the third century.  Get hold of a <span class="tooltip">docbot<span class="tooltiptext"><b>Docbots</b> are medical robots. They range in
complexity from simple first-aid bots to fully
automatic surgical and intensive-care units.</span></span> and install this chip. Report back on what happens, then remove the chip.  Under no circumstances let it fall into the hands of anyone from <span class="tooltipleft">R&amp;D<span class="tooltiptext"><b>R&amp;D</b> (Research &amp; Design) is the branch of Alpha Complex tasked with discovering weapons and techniques for fighting Commies.</span></span> or <span class="tooltipleft">IntSec<span class="tooltiptext"><b>IntSec</b> (Internal Security) is a combination of Homeland Security, riot police, and narc squad.</span></span>. Also, we're short on bot brains; if you find any lying around, be sure to bring them back to us.&rsquo;</p>

<p>It goes without saying that Pro Tech would be interested in examining any new or experimental equipment issued to your team by R&amp;D.
</p>

<p><b>Regarding Your Mission:</b> The Warbot Model 425 Mark&nbsp;4 is one of the greatest achievements of all time. The
technology that built it must be perpetuated at all costs. You must kill anyone who tries to damage or harm the Mark&nbsp;4. Gather as much information as you can about it, including blueprints if possible.</p>
