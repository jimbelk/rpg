Internal Security is a combination of Homeland
Security, riot police and narc squad. Not only
does The Computer keep tabs on everything
with omnipresent cameras and recording
devices, it also maintains Internal Security
spies as another check on the loyalty of its
citizens. Many IntSec agents are planted in
the other service groups. They have informants
everywhere.<br><br>
In addition to ratting on traitors, IntSec agents
run ‘sting’ operations designed to tempt citizens
into treason. Because promotion within IntSec
is based on the number and prestige of traitors
unmasked, IntSec agents are notorious for
rooting out treason that isn’t even there to
begin with.<br><br>
Of course, false accusations of treason are
themselves treason. However, if an IntSec
agent and a regular citizen mutually accuse
each other of treason, all else being equal, The
Computer is more likely to believe the agent.</span></span> operative assigned to spy on this Troubleshooter team.  You have also been assigned to spy on <span class="tooltipbottom" style="text-indent: 0; padding-left:0;">Foes-N-Stocks HPD<span class="tooltiptext"><b>Foes-N-Stocks HPD</b> (Public Hating Coordination)<br>
<b>Service Branch:</b> Housing Production and Development &amp; Mind Control (HPD&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;MC)
<br><br>

When faced with such despicable foes as Commies, mutants and traitors, clearly, mere general hatred of Alpha Complex’s enemies falls far short. These threats to the complex’s perfect society must be despised in an organized, well-structured and highly concentrated fashion. Charged with these efforts are the Public Hating Coordinators at Foes-N-Stocks HPD, making Commie Hating, Mutant Loathing and Traitor Resentment more efficient and highly convenient for the common citizen.</span></span>, and are currently posing as an employee of that firm.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; padding-left: 2em"><b>Treason:</b> Though you pretend to be a loyal citizen, you have a <b>SECRET MUTANT POWER</b> (<span class="tooltipleft" style="text-indent: 0; padding-left:0;">puppeteering<span class="tooltiptext"><b>Puppeteer:</b> You can take remote control of a single part of a living target’s body, such as an arm, leg or trigger finger. The body part moves in all respects as if it were your own. While controlling the selected part of the target, you can still move and act normally, but must yourself make the movements you want the target to mimic.
</span></span>) and you belong to a <b>SECRET SOCIETY</b> (<span class="tooltipbottom" style="text-indent: 0; padding-left:0;">Psion<span class="tooltiptext">
<b>Psion Beliefs</b><br><br>

Power through The Power! Mutants
rule!<br><br>

Humans with psionic powers are obviously the
evolutionary successors of normal humans and
the future of the human race. Our transcendent
abilities qualify us to govern humanity. We must
bring The Computer’s traditional programming
into harmony with this principle; we must
naturally occupy all positions of power and
responsibility. If necessary, we must destroy
The Computer and its culture to make way for
the new order—the Psionic Age.<br><br>

The Psionic Age cannot arise without
suffering and disorder. Endure these to help
bring about the new era. Develop your powers,
refine them, strengthen them and learn new
powers. Protect those with psionic powers
whenever possible. Pity those without psionic
powers, but do not protect them. They are the
past. Those who survive will have a place in
our new order—subservient, but benevolently
cared for by their superior descendants.

<h2>Your Background</h2>

<p>It's hard being better than everyone else. You were smarter than the other Junior Citizens in your <span class="tooltipleft">crèche<span class="tooltiptext"><b>Crèches:</b> Teacherbots, or sometimes human supervisors, raise and educate all newly decanted Junior Citizens in communal crèches. Bots and supervisors rotate duties frequently to discourage the children from forming emotional attachments. Through frequent lessons The Computer channels the youngsters’ nascent emotional impulses into absolute loyalty to Alpha Complex.</span></span>. That's why Internal Security selected you to join them. Then you realized you were a mutant, and you used your IntSec contacts to hook up with Psion. Now you have to hide your mutation from IntSec, you have to hide your connection to IntSec from your team, and you're stuck organizing singalongs for Foes-N-Stocks HPD to maintain your cover. Oh, and you're surrounded by idiots. But it's worth it to be part of the future of Alpha Complex.</p>
