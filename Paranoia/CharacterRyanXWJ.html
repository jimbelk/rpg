<b>Example of tic in use</b><br>

<h2>Your Background</h2>

<p>You have a gift for working with plants.  You actually liked growing algae in the vats, and as you talents grew, you were transferred to the hydroponics bays to grow real food.</p>

<p>Your good fortune was interrupted by the incident with the <span class="tooltipleft">frankenstein<span class="tooltiptext"><b>Frankenstein:</b> A bot whose asimov circuit is faulty or has been removed is no longer constrained to follow the Five Laws of Robotics (Newly Revised).  Such a bot may operate treasonously, i.e. disobey Computer or human orders, and is said to have &ldquo;gone frankenstein&rdquo;.</span></span> harvestbot. They replaced your missing arm with a hunk of metal and moved you into <span class="tooltip">CPU<span class="tooltiptext"><b>CPU</b> (Central Processing Unit) is the branch of Alpha Complex tasked with maintaining all data systems, including the hardware that runs The Computer itself. CPU’s important secondary function is to

Then your first clone got killed as collateral damage in an <span class="tooltip">IntSec<span class="tooltiptext"><b>IntSec</b> (Internal Security) is a combination of Homeland Security, riot police, and narc squad.</span></span> sweep.  Sure, they gave you a credit bonus and a transfer to <span class="tooltipleft">HPD &amp; MC<span class="tooltiptext"><b>HPD &amp; MC</b> (Housing Production and Development &amp; Mind Control) is the branch of Alpha Complex tasked with providing housing, entertainment, and political education for citizens.</span></span> as compensation for an illegal termination, but how was that supposed to make it up to you?  After all, they'd killed you. Worse, after you were decanted they <i>cut off your arm</i>, replaced it with another cybernetic arm &lsquo;to maintain inventory&rsquo;.</p>

<p>You tracked down the IntSec agent who killed you and framed him for treason, which is how you got assigned to the Troubleshooters, but you're not done yet. The Computer has gone rotten. You're going to help take it down.</p>

High-clearance citizens in charge of development and production still struggle with the fact that suddenly some of their products are not treasonous not to purchase. Guessing what citizens will buy instead of just executing them until they buy it is a frightening concept.<br><br>
That’s where the Consumerism Trend Identifiers of Make What We Tell You or Else HPD come in. Guided by their commercial savvy and supported by meticulous research, these hard-working citizens can, for a nominal sum, let you know precisely which brand-new product repackaging citizens complex-wide have been clamoring for.

Alpha Complex ought to be a utopia; The Computer sees to everyone’s needs and desires. But something has gone disastrously wrong.

There are no Commies; no one is plotting to destroy Alpha Complex. The Computer is insane. We must bring The Computer back under the control of human beings.<br><br>
All power to the people! Greedy High Programmers control the system and enrich themselves. They are evil. Humanist leaders are wise and know what is best for the people. They should lead Alpha Complex, help us to fulfill human aspirations and desires. All citizens should join us and help us make Alpha Complex a utopia.
