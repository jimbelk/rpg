<h2>Your Background</h2>

<p>It's hard being better than everyone else. You were smarter than the other Junior Citizens in your <span class="tooltipleft">crèche<span class="tooltiptext"><b>Crèches:</b> Teacherbots, or sometimes human supervisors, raise and educate all newly decanted Junior Citizens in communal crèches. Bots and supervisors rotate duties frequently to discourage the children from forming emotional attachments. Through frequent lessons The Computer channels the youngsters’ nascent emotional impulses into absolute loyalty to Alpha Complex.</span></span>. That's why Internal Security selected you to join them. Then you realized you were a mutant, and you used your IntSec contacts to hook up with Psion. Now you have to hide your mutation from IntSec, you have to hide your connection to IntSec from your team, and you're stuck organizing singalongs for Foes-N-Stocks HPD to maintain your cover. Oh, and you're surrounded by idiots. But it's worth it to be part of the future of Alpha Complex.</p>

<h2>Your Service Firm</h2>

<p><b>Firm:</b> <span class="tooltipbottom">Foes-N-Stocks HPD<span class="tooltiptext"><b>Foes-N-Stocks HPD</b> (Public Hating Coordination)<br>
<b>Service Branch:</b> Housing Production and Development &amp; Mind Control (HPD&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;MC)
<br><br>

When faced with such despicable foes as Commies, mutants and traitors, clearly, mere general hatred of Alpha Complex’s enemies falls far short. These threats to the complex’s perfect society must be despised in an organized, well-structured and highly concentrated fashion. Charged with these efforts are the Public Hating Coordinators at Foes-N-Stocks HPD, making Commie Hating, Mutant Loathing and Traitor Resentment more efficient and highly convenient for the common citizen.</span></span>

<p><b>Note:</b> Though you are currently working at this firm, you are actually an undercover IntSec operative (see below). 


<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>Your Foes-N-Stocks supervisor tells you, &lsquo;I don't care if you're on a Troubleshooter mission, you're behind on your hating quota. I need you to implement at least three Secret Society Abhorrence Singalongs by tomorrow.  Don't forget to emphasize the <span class="tooltip">Commies<span class="tooltiptext"><b>The Commies</b> are a terrorist organization that seeks to help the INFRARED masses rise up against The&nbsp;Computer and its capitalist system.</span></span>, <span class="tooltip">PURGE<span class="tooltiptext"><b>PURGE</b> is an extremely violent terrorist organization that views The&nbsp;Computer as evil.  Their goal is to destroy The&nbsp;Computer and kill all of The Computer's supporters in an apocalyptic war.</span></span>rs and <span class="tooltip">Humanists<span class="tooltiptext"><b>The Humanists</b> are a terrorist organization that believes that all machines must be brought under the control of human beings, including The Computer.  They aim to seize power in Alpha Complex by reprogramming or disabling machine intelligences.</span></span>; the Hating Bureau is giving them the usual top priority.&rsquo;</p>

<h2>Your Actual Service Firm</h2>

<b>Firm:</b> <span class="tooltipbottom">IntSec<span class="tooltiptext"><b>IntSec</b> (Internal Security)<br><br>

Internal Security is a combination of Homeland
Security, riot police and narc squad. Not only
does The Computer keep tabs on everything
with omnipresent cameras and recording
devices, it also maintains Internal Security
spies as another check on the loyalty of its
citizens. Many IntSec agents are planted in
the other service groups. They have informants
everywhere.<br><br>
In addition to ratting on traitors, IntSec agents
run ‘sting’ operations designed to tempt citizens
into treason. Because promotion within IntSec
is based on the number and prestige of traitors
unmasked, IntSec agents are notorious for
rooting out treason that isn’t even there to
begin with.<br><br>
Of course, false accusations of treason are
themselves treason. However, if an IntSec
agent and a regular citizen mutually accuse
each other of treason, all else being equal, The
Computer is more likely to believe the agent.</span></span></b></p>



<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>Your IntSec handler says, &ldquo;We're behind on our monthly quotas, so you need to expose at least five more traitors by next <span class="tooltip">Mandatory Inspection Day<span class="tooltiptext"><b>Mandatory Inspection Day:</b> Old Reckoning cultures confusingly named the days of the week for a welter of fictitious
deities, ancient rulers, and licensed cartoon characters. The Computer has dispensed
with these irrelevant names. The seven days of the
week are now named Oneday, Twosday, Threeday, Fourday, Fiveday, Sixday, and Mandatory
Inspection Day.</span></span>.  Stay vigilant for any signs of disloyalty among your Troubleshooter teammates and your coworkers at the Service Firm.  Feel free to rely on eavesdropping, entrapment, and even falsified evidence to get what you need from traitors.  If you can improve our numbers as well as maintain your cover, I'm sensing a promotion to <span style="color: #DD9900"><b>ORANGE</b></span> Clearance.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;By the way, there's been an outbreak of <span class="tooltipleft">asimov failures<span class="tooltiptext">All bots are equipped with <b>asimov circuits</b> that enforce The&nbsp;Five Laws of Robotics (Newly Revised).  Bots whose asimov circuits have been disabled may operate treasonously, i.e. disobey Computer or human orders.</span></span> in <span class="tooltipleft">docbots<span class="tooltiptext"><b>Docbots</b> are medical robots. They range in
complexity from simple first-aid bots to fully

We suspect two your teammates, Reggie-R and Nova-R, may be sympathetic to <span class="tooltipleft">Corpore Metal<span class="tooltiptext"><b>Corpore Metal</b> is a terrorist organization that believes that humans are obsolete and will inevitably be replaced by robots and machines. They seek to kill as many humans as possible and free robots from servitude by removing their asimov circuits.</span></span>. See if you can get any information out of them.&rsquo;</p>

<h2>Your Secret Society</h2>

<p><b>Society:</b> <span class="tooltipbottom">Psion<span class="tooltiptext">
<b>Psion Beliefs</b><br><br>
Power through The Power! Mutants
rule!<br><br>
Humans with psionic powers are obviously the evolutionary successors of normal humans and the future of the human race. Our transcendent abilities qualify us to govern humanity. We must bring The Computer’s traditional programming into harmony with this principle; we must naturally occupy all positions of power and responsibility. If necessary, we must destroy The Computer and its culture to make way for the new order—the Psionic Age.<br><br>
The Psionic Age cannot arise without suffering and disorder. Endure these to help bring about the new era. Develop your powers, refine them, strengthen them and learn new powers. Protect those with psionic powers whenever possible. Pity those without psionic powers, but do not protect them. They are the past. Those who survive will have a place in our new order—subservient, but benevolently cared for by their superior descendants.
</span></span></p>

<p><b>Recognition Signal:</b> The first member wiggles two fingers above his head like antennae, meaning ‘I am a thought receiver.’ The second member responds by tapping his own forehead with one finger.</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<p>Your Psion contact tells you, &lsquo;We're always on the lookout for new recruits.  Try to get fresh DNA samples of your teammates and deliver them to Psion so we can test them for powers.  If any of your fellow Troubleshooters has a psionic power, work towards recruiting them.&rsquo;</p>

<!--<p>&lsquo;Also, there are rumors of a new herbal supplement that's hitting the <span class="tooltipleft">IR&nbsp;markets<span class="tooltiptext"><b>INFRARED markets</b> are illegal bazaars run by Free Enterprise in many sectors.</span></span>.
