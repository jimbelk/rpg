	<h1>Map of the North</h1>
	<p>Here is a map of the local region, known as &quot;The North&quot; because the 
	largest drow cities lie to the south of this map. To give a sense of scale, the Darklake 
	is about 100 miles across.&nbsp; The colors of the dots show depth beneath 
	the surface:</p>
	<p class="auto-style1"><strong>Red dots</strong> show locations in the 
	Upperworld.</p>
	<p class="auto-style1"><strong>Yellow dots</strong> show locations in the 
	Middleworld.</p>
	<p class="auto-style1"><strong>Blue dots</strong> show locations in the 
	Lowerworld.</p>
	<p>Hover over a dot or area to see a description. (The same descriptions 
	appear below the map.)</p>
