	<img class="a" width="400px" src="Quaggoths.jpg"/><h1>Quaggoths</h1>
	<p>Quaggoths are a race of monstrous humanoids that resemble albino cave 
	bears. Primitive and simple, they are forced into slavery by other 
	races&mdash;especially the drow.</p>
	<p><strong>Physical Description:</strong> A quaggoth is a humanoid with 
	beastlike features, having a head something like that of a bear. A typical 
	male quaggoth stands just over 6 feet tall and weighs 250 pounds or more. 
	Female quaggoths are slightly smaller, but no lighter. They stand about 
	5-1/2 feet tall and have the same build as males, though they tend to 
	obesity. Regardless of gender, every quaggoth has thick white fur over a 
	densely muscular body, though some quaggoths dye or paint their fur black to 
	camouflage themselves better.</p>
	<p><strong>Quaggoth Society:</strong> Though quaggoths are numerous, many 
	serve the <a href="Drow.htm">drow</a> as slaves. These poor souls suffer 
	terribly under pitiless overseers who work them to death or expend them in 
	large numbers for the interminable contests between houses.</p>
	<p>Those that manage to avoid the slavers form clans that can include up to 
	fifty members. On rare occasions, several clans might meet in a massive 
	cavern to hold a gathering. Such convocations occur after a series of 
	damaging attacks on quaggoth holdings or if some other danger threatens them 
	as a whole.</p>
	<p>Among these savages are two general outlooks. Most quaggoths abide by the 
	old customs and &quot;follow the beast.&quot; They are extremely violent and reckless, 
	seeing no point in using weaponry or making any advances to their society. 
	Such quaggoths are virtually indistinguishable in nature and outlook from 
	wild animals. The other quaggoths &quot;follow magic.&quot; This expression is 
	something of a misnomer, since spellcasting among the quaggoths is extremely 
	rare. Instead, these individuals improve upon their innate strengths, which 
	they see as a gift from their gods (though still primitive and elemental). 
	They revel in the power of the weapons they wield, treating them as mystical 
	relics, and seek out magic items of all kinds. They mark their choice by 
	dying their white fur with dung, blood, and black ichor. Those who follow 
	magic are the prominent members of their clans. They are generally more 
	intelligent, usually becoming war leaders, and don't throw their lives away 
	recklessly.&nbsp; </p>
	<p><strong>Quaggoth Tribes:</strong> Quaggoths can be found anywhere, but 
	they prefer the Middleworld and Lowerworld to the Upperworld. A quaggoth 
	community is filthy, fouled by droppings, piles of bones, rotting meat, and 
	rubbish heaped against the walls. Quaggoth lairs are rife with disease, and 
	many clans are weakened by outbreaks of filth fever.</p>
	<p>Feral bands of quaggoths haunt many of the lonelier portions of the 
	world, existing as roving bands of marauders who prey on anything they can 
	catch. Bloodthirsty and savage, quaggoths can descend into a screaming 
	animal frenzy at the slightest provocation, losing any semblance of reason 
	until they destroy (or are destroyed by) whatever foe they happen to 
	encounter.</p>
	<p><strong>Religion:</strong> Quaggoth clerics are extremely rare and are 
	usually devoted to demons or gods of trickery and death.</p>
	<p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Quaggoths are usually neutral evil. They are 
	self-interested beings, with little understanding of or concern for the 
	consequences of their actions, motivated purely to fulfill their every 
	desire.</p>
	<p><strong>Adventurers:</strong> Like minotaurs, quaggoths are frequently 
	found as slaves and warriors in the cities of more civilized folk. Quaggoth 
	mercenaries can find work almost anywhere. While few actually become 
	adventurers, some have risen above the bloodlust and senseless violence of 
	their kin to become the stalwart companions of adventuring parties. Good 
	quaggoths often pit themselves against the tyranny of those evil races that 
	hold their kinfolk in slavery.</p>
