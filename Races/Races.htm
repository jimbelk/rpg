<div class="wholedoc">
	<h1>Races</h1>
	<p>This is a list of the most common &quot;civilized&quot; races in the campaign 
	world. You have met and talked with members of each of these races during 
	your time in Gracklstugh.</p>
	<h2>Major Races</h2>
	<p>
	<strong>
	<a href="Drow.htm"><img class="auto-style4" src="Drow.jpg" style="float: left" width="180">Drow</a></strong> (or elves) are the most numerous, powerful, and 
	widespread of the world's native peoples. The majority of the elves live in 
	city-states ruled by various noble Houses, each of which commands its own 
	small army of fearless drow soldiers, cunning wizards, and zealous 
	priestesses, as well as large contingents of slave soldiers, such as 
	bugbears, ogres, and minotaurs.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>
	<a href="Duergar.htm">
	<img src="Duergar.jpg" style="float: right; padding-left: 10px" width="220"><strong>Duergar</strong></a> 
	(or gray dwarves) are a grim and determined race that lead lives of 
	neverending toil in their great foundry-cities. The gray dwarves are nearly 
	as widespread and numerous as the drow, and the typical duergar realm is 
	every bit as strong, cruel, and wealthy as a great city of the elves. But 
	while most&nbsp;drow cities exist to exalt the high nobility of the elves, 
	duergar cities exist only for the manufacture of wealth through unending 
	labor. </p>
	<p>
	<strong><a href="Svirfneblin.htm">	<img class="auto-style4" src="Svirfneblin.jpg" style="float: left" width="150">Svirfneblin</a></strong> 
	(or gnomes) are a silent and wary race that dwell in mines and caverns 
	throughout the world. Unlike more traditional gnomes, the svirfneblin are 
	suspicious and serious creatures. Their holdings are hidden from the 
	predatory races that live nearby because only caution, stealth, and 
	cooperation with others of their kind stand between the svirfneblin and a 
	terrible end.</p>
	<h2>
	&nbsp;</h2>
	<h2>
	Minor Races</h2>
	<p>
	<strong><a href="Dromites.htm"><img src="Dromite.jpg" style="float: right" width="130" class="auto-style5">Dromites</a></strong> 
	are a diminutive insectoid race that live in small, hidden hives throughout 
	the world.&nbsp; Dromites have hardened, chitin-encrusted skin, 
	compound eyes like those of an insect, and two small antennae protruding 
	from their brows. Called “bugs” by the ignorant, dromites share far more 
	traits with other humanoids than they do with insects.</p>
	<p>
	<a href="Goblins.htm">
	<img class="auto-style1" src="Goblin.jpg" style="float: left" width="120"><strong>Goblins</strong></a> 
	are a race of childlike creatures with a destructive and voracious nature 
	that makes them almost universally despised. Many goblins are held as slaves 
	by the duergar and drow, while others live in small tribes on the outskirts 
	of civilized areas, launching raids for food and supplies.</p>
	<p>
	<a href="Kobolds.htm">
	<img src="Kobold.jpg" style="float: right" width="130"><strong>Kobolds</strong></a><strong>
	</strong>are weak, craven race that claim kinship to&nbsp;dragons. Though they 
	are hardworking, clever, and blessed with a natural talent for mechanical 
	devices and mining, they spend their days nursing grudges and hatreds 
	instead of celebrating their own gifts. Many kobolds are kept as slaves by 
	the drow, while others live in huge underground warrens mining, farming 
	fungus, and building traps. Kobolds often attack travellers out of spite.</p>
	<p>
	<a href="Kuo-Toas.htm">
	<img class="auto-style1" src="Kuo-Toa.jpg" style="float: left" width="220"><strong>Kuo-Toas</strong></a> 
	are theocratic fishfolk who dwell in the deep seas and lakes of the world. 
	The clerics of Blibdoolpoolp, called whips, exercise iron control over the 
	population. Second in status to the&nbsp;clerics&nbsp;are the monks, who are known as 
	monitors. Kuo-toa make excellent guides, but they have a reputation for 
	duplicity.&nbsp; The kuo-toa are closely allied with the drow, and as such 
	are not well-liked by the duergar.</p>
	<p>
	<a href="Orogs.htm">
	<img src="Orog.jpg" style="float: right" width="250"><strong>Orogs</strong></a> 
	are the primary race of orcs in this world. Unlike the orcs you are used to, 
	orogs are not overly warlike and do not revel in the act of war, though they 
	do enjoy its spoils. Orogs have mastered the art of forging armor and 
	weapons from the strange ores found beneath the ground, and an orog rarely 
	goes anywhere without being fully armed and armored.</p>
	<p>
	<a href="Quaggoths.htm">
	<img class="auto-style1" src="Quaggoths.jpg" style="float: left" width="320"><strong>Quaggoths</strong></a><strong> </strong>
	are a race of monstrous humanoids that resemble albino cave bears. Primitive 
	and simple, they are forced into slavery by other races—especially the drow. 
	Free quaggoths live in clans throughout the world, forming primitive 
	settlements and living by hunting and gathering or raising livestock.</p>
	<p>
	<a href="Ratfolk.htm">
	<img src="Ratfolk.jpg" style="float: right" width="170"><strong>Ratfolk</strong></a> 
	are small, rodent-like&nbsp;humanoids, most often found in nomadic trading 
	caravans. Much like the pack rats they resemble, ratfolk are tinkerers and 
	hoarders by nature, and as a whole are masters of commerce, especially when 
	it comes to acquiring and repairing mechanical or magical devices. Though 
	some are shrewd merchants who carefully navigate the shifting alliances of 
	black markets and bazaars, many ratfolk love their stockpiles of interesting 
	items far more than money, and would rather trade for more such prizes to 
	add to their hoards over mere coins. </p>
