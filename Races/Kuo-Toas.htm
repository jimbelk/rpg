<div class="wholedoc">
	<img class="a" width="440px" src="Kuo-Toa.jpg"/><h1>Kuo-Toas</h1>
	<p>Kuo&#8288;-&#8288;toas are theocratic fishfolk who dwell in the deep seas and lakes of 
	the world. The 
	<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/">clerics</a> of Blibdoolpoolp, called whips, exercise iron control 
	over the population. Second in status to the 
	<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/">clerics</a> are the 
	<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/monk">monks</a>, who are 
	known as monitors.</p>
	<p>Much of kuo&#8288;-&#8288;toan life and society focuses on religion. The church forms 
	the center of every community, both physically and metaphysically. Each 
	kuo&#8288;-&#8288;toa city is ruled by a Sunken Council&mdash;a group of nine high-level 
	<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/">clerics</a> who direct the citizens in their religious observances. Larger kuo&#8288;-&#8288;toa 
	settlements usually have ornate churches that 
	sponsor frequent celebrations in honor of their mad deity, whom they call 
	the Sea Mother. A smaller enclave might have only a simple shrine and 
	periodic visits from a low&#8288;-&#8288;level priest.</p>
	<p>Kuo&#8288;-&#8288;toas spend much of their leisure time in the spawning pools. Young 
	kuo&#8288;-&#8288;toa hatch in these sheltered pools and spend their first year of life 
	there. Only after their amphibian qualities fully develop can they leave the 
	pools to become full-fledged members of kuo&#8288;-&#8288;toan society.</p>
	<p><strong>Personality:</strong> Kuo&#8288;-&#8288;toas view everyone with suspicion; in 
	fact, they often report real or alleged transgressions of even their own 
	family members to the community 
	<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/">cleric</a>. Justice (or at least trial, 
	sentencing, and punishment) follows swiftly.</p>
	<p>Kuo&#8288;-&#8288;toas have a well-deserved reputation for dealing duplicitously with 
	other races, though the <a href="Drow.htm">drow</a> are a notable exception 
	to this rule. The typical kuo&#8288;-&#8288;toa has no scruples about betraying a trust if 
	he feels that doing so is in his best interests and not apt to produce 
	unwanted repercussions.</p>
	<p><strong>Physical Description:</strong> A kuo&#8288;-&#8288;toa sports fine scales of 
	varying pigmentation. The color varies with his mood, ranging from dark red 
	when he is angry to white when he is frightened. A kuotoa’s body is shaped 
	like that of a short, pudgy human, but his slender arms and legs end in 
	broad hands and distended feet that resemble flippers. The air around a 
	kuo&#8288;-&#8288;toa carries a faint odor of rotting fish. This scent is natural but can 
	be enhanced by piscine perfumes of kuo&#8288;-&#8288;toan manufacture.</p>
	<p><strong>Relations:</strong> The kuo&#8288;-&#8288;toas maintain friendly relations with 
	the <a href="Drow.htm">drow</a>. At one point during the Awakening War, the 
	kuo&#8288;-&#8288;toan clergy issued edicts naming all <a href="Drow.htm">drow</a> as 
	honorary kuo&#8288;-&#8288;toas and welcoming them into kuo&#8288;-&#8288;toan settlements. The only 
	portions of a kuo&#8288;-&#8288;toan settlement where drow are forbidden are the church 
	and the spawning pools. The kuo&#8288;-&#8288;toas also tolerate the servants, slaves, and 
	allies of the drow, giving them the same level of access as they do the 
	elves. Exactly what prompted this expansive gesture remains a mystery, but 
	many <a href="Drow.htm">drow</a> and kuo&#8288;-&#8288;toa communities have since 
	established mutually beneficial trading practices, and mixed settlements are 
	not unusual.</p>
	<p>Kuo&#8288;-&#8288;toas and <a href="Drow.htm">drow</a> share a common hatred of the
	<a href="Svirfneblin.htm">svirfneblin</a>, and the two races frequently band 
	together to hunt gnomes. Victorious raiding parties offer
	<a href="Svirfneblin.htm">svirfneblin</a> prisoners to the kuo&#8288;-&#8288;toan church 
	for sacrifice.</p>
	<p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Outsiders generally perceive kuo&#8288;-&#8288;toas as evil 
	and loathsome, and this assessment is not an unfair representation of the 
	Sea Mother’s bloodthirsty 
	<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/">clerics</a> and 
	<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/monk">monks</a>. Common kuo&#8288;-&#8288;toas, however, 
	generally lack the cruelty and zeal of the theocratic and noble classes. 
	Such kuo&#8288;-&#8288;toas often follow neutral (and occasionally even good) 
	philosophies, forming a nonvocal majority in most kuo&#8288;-&#8288;toan settlements. 
	Because of the repressive theocracy under which they live, nonevil kuo&#8288;-&#8288;toas 
	usually remain silent, lest their attitudes get them sacrificed to the Sea 
	Mother.</p>
	<p><strong>Religion:</strong> Kuo&#8288;-&#8288;toa clergy are quick to root out and 
	censure anyone or anything they perceive as a threat. Because of the swift 
	and arbitrary punishments meted out by the whips, the average kuo&#8288;-&#8288;toa 
	follows the rituals of Blibdoolpoolp and fulfills the expectations of the 
	clergy, whether or not he feels especially pious.</p>
	<p>The current edicts of the high priests state that Blibdoolpoolp demands 
	frequent sacrifices, which must be drowned in special sacrificial pools. If 
	the clergy feel especially benevolent, they use prisoners or slaves (often
	<a href="Svirfneblin.htm">svirfneblin</a>) to fulfill this requirement. If 
	the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/">clerics</a> perceive their flock as less than fervent in devotion, however, 
	each sacrifice includes one or more kuo&#8288;-&#8288;toa parishioners. <a href="Drow.htm">
	Drow</a> are never sacrificed to Blibdoolpoolp, and the servants and slaves 
	of the <a href="Drow.htm">drow</a> are usually spared as well.</p>
	<p><strong>Adventurers:</strong> Kuo&#8288;-&#8288;toan society provides ample reasons for 
	any nonconformist kuo&#8288;-&#8288;toa to adopt the adventuring life and travel far away 
	from the areas controlled by the Sea Mother’s clergy. Unfortunately, 
	kuo&#8288;-&#8288;toas typically face prejudice from every other race except
	<a href="Drow.htm">drow</a>. As a result, they often join mixed-race 
	adventuring groups, hoping that the diversity will encourage acceptance. 
	Adventuring kuo&#8288;-&#8288;toas often make pilgrimages back home on an annual basis to 
	partake of the spawning pools.</p>

		<li><strong>Natural Amor:</strong> Kuo⁠-⁠toas have a +6 natural armor 
		bonus because of their scaly skin.</li>
		<li><strong>Kuo⁠-⁠toa Immunities:</strong> Kuo⁠-⁠toas are immune to

		<li><strong>Resistance:</strong> Kuo⁠-⁠toas have electricity 
		resistance&nbsp;10.</li>
		<li><strong>Slippery (Ex):</strong> A kuo⁠-⁠toa secretes an oily film 
		that makes him difficult to grapple or snare. Webs (magic or otherwise) 
		don’t affect kuo⁠-⁠toas, and they usually can wriggle free from most 
		other forms of confinement.</li>

		weapon rather than an exotic weapon.</li>
	</ul>
	<p style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;margin-left:20px" class="auto-style3">
	Senses Racial Traits</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Darkvision:</strong> Kuo⁠-⁠toas can see perfectly in the 
		dark up to 60&nbsp;feet.</li>
		<li><strong>Keen Sight (Ex):</strong> Kuo⁠-⁠toas have excellent vision 
		thanks to their two independently focusing eyes. Their eyesight is so 
		keen that a kuo⁠-⁠toa can sense the presence of any creature within 
		30&nbsp;feet that is invisible or ethereal, and can pinpoint the location of 
		such a creature if it is moving. </li>
	</ul>
	<p style="font-weight:bold;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;margin-left:20px">
	Offense Racial Traits</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Natural Attacks:</strong> A kuo⁠-⁠toa has a bite attack 
		(1d4), which is a primary natural attack. A kuo⁠-⁠toa who attacks with a 
		weapon can also make a bite as a secondary attack.</li>
		<li><strong>Adhesive (Ex):</strong> A kuo⁠-⁠toa can use his own body oil 
		and other materials to give a shield a finish almost like flypaper, 
		capable of holding fast any creatures or items that touch it. Any 
		creature that makes an unsuccessful melee attack against a kuo⁠-⁠toa 
		must succeed on a Reflex save (DC&nbsp;11&nbsp;+ kuo⁠-⁠toa’s Con&nbsp;modifier), or the 
		weapon sticks to the shield and is yanked out of its wielder’s grip. A 
		creature using a natural weapon is automatically
		<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#Grapple">
		grappled</a> if it gets stuck. A kuo⁠-⁠toa requires one hour and special 
		materials costing 20 gp to coat a shield with adhesive, but the 
		secretion remains sticky for up to three days, or until it actually 
		catches something or someone, whichever comes first. Successfully 
		trapping a creature or item uses up the adhesive, so the shield can trap 
		no further creatures or items until its coating is replenished. Pulling 
		a stuck weapon or limb from a shield requires a DC 20 Strength check.</li>
	</ul>
	<p style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;margin-left:20px" class="auto-style3">
	Weakness Racial Traits</p>

		blindness</a>. Abrupt exposure to any bright light blinds a kuo⁠-⁠toa for
