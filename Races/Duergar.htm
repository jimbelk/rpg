<div class="wholedoc">
	<img class="a" width="370px" style="padding-top: 30px" src="Duergar.jpg"/><h1>Duergar</h1>
	<p>Grim and determined, the duergar (or gray dwarves) lead lives of 
	neverending toil in their great foundry-cities. The gray dwarves are nearly 
	as widespread and numerous as the <a href="Drow.htm">drow</a>, and the 
	typical duergar realm is every bit as strong, cruel, and wealthy as a great 
	city of the dark elves. But while most <a href="Drow.htm">drow</a> cities 
	exist to exalt the high nobility of the dark elves, duergar cities exist 
	only for the manufacture of wealth through unending labor.</p>
	<p>Duergar are sullen, insular, and industrious, but they tend to be better 
	neighbors than drow and are less likely to raid the surrounding area or seek 
	out victims to torment. They are the preeminent artisans and merchants of 
	the world, and duergar caravans cross every corner of the Middleworld. The 
	gray dwarves are all too willing to enslave any likely creatures that fall 
	into their hands, but they don't waste slaves in the sort of cruel 
	spectacles that the drow enjoy. Instead, the duergar simply work their 
	captives to death.</p>
	<p><strong>Personality:</strong> Though gray dwarves do display the 
	redeeming virtues of courage and determination, they are also avaricious, 
	short-tempered, sullen, violent, and ungrateful. Duergar nurse grudges until 
	they die and never stop counting the slights (real or imagined) that they've 
	received. They are inclined to believe that might makes right, so most have 
	no pity for those who are too weak to defend their property or themselves 
	against a stronger foe. Duergar are not above launching fearsome raids to 
	garner the gold they love so well from their weaker neighbors.</p>
	<p>On the positive side, duergar believe in minding their own business (so 
	long as others don't have anything they want) and working hard to excel at 
	their chosen crafts. No obstacle daunts a gray dwarf who has settled on a 
	goal. Duergar may not display much loyalty to anyone other than themselves, 
	but they never leave a job half done.</p>
	<p><strong>Physical Description:</strong> The typical gray dwarf stands 
	about 4&nbsp;to 4-1/2 feet tall, but her physique is lean and hard compared with 
	a traditional dwarf. Her skin is a dull, lifeless, gray color, and her eyes 
	are black and cold. A male duergar doesn't have a wisp of hair above his 
	ears, but he may boast a short, wiry beard of iron-gray or black hair. The 
	typical female duergar is likewise bald, but a few have short-cropped hair 
	of dull black.</p>
	<p><strong>Relations:</strong> Duergar are universally disliked by all other 
	beings, including each other. They are churlish and hateful, and they want 
	nothing to do with other races unless they stand to gain something from the 
	encounter. Of the other races, duergar find the svirfneblin and the
	<a href="Orogs.htm">orogs</a> the least irritating, since the deep gnomes 
	and deep orcs are also outstanding artisans who value hard work. The gray 
	dwarves can't stand the <a href="Drow.htm">drow</a>, probably because they 
	can sense the condescension and mockery behind dark elf courtesy.</p>
	<p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Most gray dwarves are evil, placing little 
	value on the lives and property of others. They are consumed by envy of 
	anyone better off than themselves, and they display not a trace of pity for 
	those who are not as fortunate. A fair number of duergar, wanting nothing 
	more than to be left alone, lean toward hardhearted neutrality, but few ever 
	become truly good.</p>
	<p><strong>Religion:</strong> The patron deity of the gray dwarves is 
	Laduguer, the God of Toil. Duergar spend little time or effort on any sort 
	of religious observances because they feel that the best way to venerate 
	their grim god is to work. Some gray dwarves also venerate Deep Duerra, the 
	God of the Invisible Art (psionics).</p>
	<p><strong>Adventurers:</strong> Few gray dwarves have time for such 
	nonsense as adventuring. However, occasionally an individual with no stomach 
	for a life of unceasing toil appears in duergar society. These rare gray 
	dwarves often find it expedient to seek out less hostile surroundings before 
	their fellows decide that they're not pulling their weight. A few gray dwarf 
	adventurers are exiles or fugitives who were driven out of their home cities 
	by vicious feuds between rival clans.</p>
