<div class="wholedoc">
	<img class="a" width="240px" src="Goblin.jpg"/><h1>Goblins</h1>
	<p>Goblins are a race of childlike creatures with a destructive and 
	voracious nature that makes them almost universally despised. Weak and 
	cowardly, goblins are frequently manipulated or enslaved by
	<a href="Duergar.htm">duergar</a> or <a href="Drow.htm">drow</a> that need 
	destructive, disposable foot soldiers. Those goblins that rely on their own 
	wits to survive live on the fringes of society and feed on refuse and the 
	weaker members of more civilized races.</p>
	<p>Goblins can eat nearly anything, but prefer a diet of meat and consider 
	the flesh of&nbsp;<a href="Drow.htm#">drow</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="Svirfneblin.htm">gnomes</a>&nbsp;a 
	rare and difficult-to-obtain delicacy. While they fear the bigger races, 
	goblins' short memories and bottomless appetites mean they frequently go to 
	war or execute raids against other races to sate their pernicious urges and 
	fill their vast larders. </p>
	<p><strong>Physical Description:</strong> Goblins are short, ugly
	<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">
	humanoids</a> that stand just over 3 feet tall. Their scrawny bodies are 
	topped with over-sized and usually hairless heads with massive ears and 
	beady red or occasionally yellow eyes. Goblins' skin tone varies based on 
	the surrounding environment; common skin tones include green, gray, and 
	blue, though black and even pale white goblins have been sighted. Their 
	voracious appetites are served well by their huge mouths filled with jagged 
	teeth. </p>
	<p><strong>Society:</strong> Violent but fecund, goblins exist in primitive 
	tribal structures with constant shifts in power. Rarely able to sustain 
	their own needs through fungus farming or hunting and gathering, goblin 
	tribes live where food is abundant or near places that they can steal it 
	from. Since they are incapable of building significant fortifications and 
	have been driven out of most easily accessible locations, goblins tend to 
	live in unpleasant and remote locations, and their poor building and 
	planning skills ensure that they dwell primarily in crude caves. Few goblins 
	are good with tools or skilled at fungus farming, and the rare items of any 
	value that they possess are usually cast-off implements from&nbsp;<a href="Drow.htm">drow</a>&nbsp;or 
	other civilized cultures. Goblins' appetites and poor planning lead to small 
	tribes dominated by the strongest warriors. Even the hardiest goblin leaders 
	quickly find out that their survival depends on conducting frequent raids to 
	secure sources of food and kill off the more aggressive youth of the tribe. 
	Both goblin men and women are ugly and vicious, and both sexes are just as 
	likely to rise to positions of power in a tribe. Goblin babies are almost 
	completely self-sufficient not long after birth, and such infants are 
	treated almost like pets. Many tribes raise their children communally in 
	cages or pens where adults can largely ignore them. Mortality is high among 
	young goblins, and when the adults fail to feed them or food runs low, 
	youths learn at an early age that cannibalism is sometimes the best means of 
	survival in a goblin tribe.</p>
	<p><strong>Relations:</strong> Free goblins tend to view other beings as 
	sources of food, which makes for poor relations with most civilized races. 
	Goblins often survive on the fringes of more civilized areas, preying on 
	weak or lost travelers and occasionally raiding small settlements to fuel 
	their voracious appetites. They have a special animosity toward&nbsp;<a href="Svirfneblin.htm">gnomes</a>, 
	and celebrate the capturing or killing of such victims with a feast. A huge 
	number of goblins are held as slaves by the <a href="Duergar.htm">duergar</a> 
	and <a href="Drow.htm">drow</a>, and such goblins tend towards sniveling 
	cowardice and servility.</p>
	<p><strong>Alignment and Religion:</strong> Goblins are greedy, capricious, 
	and destructive by nature, and thus most are neutral or chaotic evil. 
	Goblins worship the deity Maglubiyet.</p>
	<p><strong>Adventurers:</strong> Goblin adventurers are usually curious and 
	inclined to explore the world, though they are often killed off by their own 
	foolish misdeeds or hunted down for their random acts of destruction. Their 
	pernicious nature makes interacting with civilized races almost impossible, 
	so goblins tend to adventure on the fringes of civilization or in the wilds. 
	Goblin spellcasters prefer fire magic and bombs over almost all other 
	methods of spreading mayhem. </p>
