	Ratfolk</h1>
	<p>Ratfolk are small, rodent-like
	<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">
	humanoids</a>, most often found in nomadic trading caravans. Much like the 
	pack rats they resemble, ratfolk are tinkerers and hoarders by nature, and 
	as a whole are masters of commerce, especially when it comes to acquiring 
	and repairing mechanical or magical devices. Though some are shrewd 
	merchants who carefully navigate the shifting alliances of black markets and 
	bazaars, many ratfolk love their stockpiles of interesting items far more 
	than money, and would rather trade for more such prizes to add to their 
	hoards over mere coins. It’s common to see a successful crew of ratfolk 
	traders rolling out of a settlement with an even larger bundle than they 
	entered with, the whole mess piled precariously high on a cart drawn by 
	giant rats. </p>
	<p><strong>Physical Description:</strong> Typical ratfolk are average 4 feet 
	tall and weigh 80 pounds. They often wear robes to conceal their forms in 
	cities, as they know other
	<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">
	humanoids</a> find their rodent features distasteful. Ratfolk have a strong 
	attraction to shiny jewelry, especially copper, bronze, and gold, and many 
	decorate their ears and tails with small rings made of such metals. They are 
	known to train giant rats (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/rat/dire-rat">dire 
	rats</a> with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/simple-template-giant-cr-1">giant 
	creature</a> simple template), which they often use as pack
	<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal">
	animals</a> and mounts. </p>
	<p><strong>Society:</strong> Ratfolk are extremely communal, and live in 
	warrens with plenty of hidden crannies in which to stash their hoards or 
	flee in times of danger. They feel an intense bond with their large families 
	and kin networks, as well as with ordinary rodents of all sorts, living in 
	chaotic harmony and fighting fiercely to defend each other when threatened. 
	They are quick to use their stockpiles of gear in combat, but prefer to work 
	out differences and settle disputes with mutually beneficial trades.</p>
	<p>When a specific ratfolk warren grows overcrowded and the surrounding 
	environment won’t support a larger community, young ratfolk instinctively 
	seek out new places in which to dwell. If a large enough group of ratfolk 
	immigrants all settle down in a new area, they may create a new warren. 
	Otherwise, individual ratfolk are inclined to simply leave home and take up 
	residence elsewhere, or wander on caravan trips that last most of the year, 
	reducing the pressure of overcrowding at home. </p>
	<p><strong>Relations:</strong> Ratfolk are renowned as travelling merchants 
	and seem to get along well with most of the other races. They dislike
	<a href="Duergar.htm">duergar</a>, finding them too hidebound and cruel, but 
	are happy to trade with dwarf merchants and in dwarf cities. They find the
	<a href="Svirfneblin.htm">svirfneblin</a> unnecessarily dour, though they 
	appreciate their peaceful outlook. Ratfolk have good relations with the
	<a href="Drow.htm">drow</a>, who interpret the ratfolks' 
	natural deference as subservience, and they are particularly fond of drow 
	music and art.</p>
	<p><strong>Alignment and Religion:</strong> Ratfolk individuals are driven 
	by a desire to acquire interesting items and a compulsion to tinker with 
	complex objects. The strong ties of ratfolk communities give them an 
	appreciation for the benefits of an orderly society, even if they are 
	willing to bend those rules when excited about accomplishing their 
	individual goals. Most ratfolk are neutral, and those who take to religion 
	tend to worship deities that represent commerce and family.</p>
	<p><strong>Adventurers:</strong> Ratfolk are often driven by a desire to 
	seek out new opportunities for trade, both for themselves and for their 
	warrens. Ratfolk adventurers may seek potential markets for their clan’s 
	goods, keep an eye out for sources of new commodities, or just wander about 
	in hopes of unearthing enough treasure to fund less dangerous business 
	ventures. Ratfolk battles are often decided by cunning traps, ambushes, or 
	sabotage of enemy positions, and accordingly young ratfolk heroes often take 
	up classes such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/alchemist">alchemist</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/gunslinger">gunslinger</a>,
