<div class="wholedoc">
	<img class="a" width="315px" src="Drow.jpg"/><h1>Drow</h1>
	<p>The drow (or elves) are perhaps the most numerous, powerful, and 
	widespread of the world’s native peoples. The majority of the elves live in 
	city-states ruled by various noble Houses. Each House commands its own small 
	army of fearless drow soldiers, cunning wizards, and zealous priestesses, as 
	well as large contingents of slave soldiers, such as bugbears, ogres, and 
	minotaurs. In fact, half to two-thirds of any drow city’s population 
	consists of humanoid slaves and rabble, all of whom are subject to the 
	cruelty and whims of any passing elf.</p>
	<p><strong>Personality:</strong> Most drow are cruel, arrogant, and 
	hedonistic. Their eternal game of advancement at the expense of others, 
	which is encouraged by the spider goddess herself, has made the elves into a 
	race of scheming backstabbers eager to increase their own stations by 
	pulling down those ahead of them and crushing their inferiors underfoot. 
	Drow trust no one and nothing, and most are incapable of compassion, 
	kindness, or love. Many elves are actively murderous and 
	delight in the giving of pain.</p>
	<p>While dark elves neither honor their promises nor maintain personal 
	loyalties once it becomes inconvenient to do so, their pride lends them a 
	certain sense of style and an appreciation of subtlety. Drow can be 
	courteous and urbane, even to deadly rivals. They enjoy surrounding 
	themselves with things of beauty, giving hardly a thought to the cost. Any 
	drow city features breathtaking architecture and elegant revels marked by 
	dark and delicious entertainments, but only a fool would lower his guard in 
	such an environment.</p>
	<p><strong>Physical Description:</strong> The skin of a drow can be any 
	shade from dark gray to polished obsidian. His hair can be pale yellow, 
	silver, or white, and his eyes can be almost any color, including blood red. 
	Drow are short and slender compared to traditional elves, but they are 
	strong for their size. Most elves—especially nobles—are strikingly 
	handsome individuals; <a href="../Gods/Lolth.htm">Lolth</a> does not favor meek, plain, or unassuming 
	worshipers.</p>
	<p><strong>Relations:</strong> Drow regard all other races as inferior. Some 
	they view as potential slaves, others as deadly vermin to be exterminated. 
	None, however, are considered truly equal to the elves. Drow maintain a 
	grudging respect for <a href="Duergar.htm">duergar</a> and mind flayers, since the gray dwarves and 
	illithids also build powerful cities and have demonstrated the strength to 
	stand up to repeated assaults from the elves.</p>
	<p><strong>Alignment:</strong> The great majority of drow are evil through 
	and through, and most tend toward the chaotic end of the lawful/chaotic 
	spectrum. In general, drow believe in doing what they want to do, when they 
	want to do it. Elves who turn to good are few and far between, but such 
	can become powerful champions against tyranny and cruelty.</p>
	<p><strong>Religion: </strong>Most drow cities are dominated by priestesses 
	of <a href="../Gods/Lolth.htm">Lolth, the Spider Queen</a>. As the special patron and protector of the elves,
	<a href="../Gods/Lolth.htm">Lolth</a> demands abject obedience and unflinching ruthlessness from her 
	followers.</p>
	<p><strong>Adventurers:</strong> The vicissitudes of House fortunes make 
	adventuring an attractive profession for many drow. Dark elf adventurers use 
	adventuring as a means of accumulating the power and magic necessary to 
	avenge themselves upon the rivals who brought them low.</p>

	<h2>
	Drow Nobles</h2>
	<img class="a" width="350px" src="DrowNoble.jpg"/><p>About one out of every 20 drow is gifted with special powers from birth. 
	These special births are engineered and encouraged among the ruling caste, 
	and are far more likely to occur when the mother is of noble heritage. 
	Strangely, the status of the father seems not to increase or decrease the 
	chances of a child being born a drow noble. It is rare for a drow noble to 
	be born to common parents, but those who are usually murder their parents or 
	family before they come of age in order to hide the truth of their base 
	upbringing and to ease the processes of joining one of their society’s noble 
	houses. Drow nobles are more powerful than the majority of their kin, and as 
	such they quickly rise to power within their houses. Advancement through the 
	hierarchy of a drow noble house is usually accomplished through a 
	combination of assassination, seduction, and treachery, leading most drow in 
	power to be overly paranoid. </p>
	<h3>Drow Noble Racial Traits</h3>
	<p>Drow nobles possess all of the racial traits of a typical drow, plus the 
	following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>+4 Dexterity, +2 Intelligence, +2 Wisdom, +2 Charisma, &minus;2 
		Constitution</strong>. Noble drow are very agile, observant, and regal. 
		These ability score modifiers replace the standard drow ability score 
		modifiers. </li>
		<li><strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> Drow nobles have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Spell-Resistance">spell 
		resistance</a>&nbsp;equal to 11 + their character level.</li>
