	Svirfneblin</h1>
	<p>Silent and wary, the svirfneblin (or gnomes) dwell in mines and caverns 
	throughout the world. Unlike more traditional gnomes, the svirfneblin are 
	suspicious and serious creatures. Their holdings are hidden from the 
	predatory races that live nearby because only caution, stealth, and 
	cooperation with others of their kind stand between the svirfneblin and a 
	terrible end.</p>
	<p>Svirfneblin are master artisans, miners, and gemcutters. Their handiwork 
	is prized throughout the world, and the boldest gnomes are welcomed as 
	neutral merchants among many races. They make superior guides, scouts, and 
	foragers because they often know passages and portals long lost to other 
	races, and few can match the stealth or cunning of svirfneblin rangers 
	watching over their own territory.</p>
	<p><strong>Personality:</strong> Svirfneblin are suspicious and slow to give 
	their trust. They have little desire to meet new people, so most svirfneblin 
	appear grim, sullen, and pessimistic to others. Anyone who takes the 
	considerable trouble to befriend a gnome, however, usually finds him to be a 
	loyal and unflinching comrade whose pragmatic outlook is balanced by a wry, 
	self-deprecating wit.</p>
	<p>Svirfneblin admire well-wrought metalwork and weapons, but they love the 
	beauty of gemstones with a passion that seems impossible for creatures with 
	such dour personalities. They are diligent, industrious, and tireless in the 
	pursuit of excellence. Gnomes believe that anything worth doing is worth 
	doing well, no matter how long it takes or how difficult it turns out to be.</p>
	<p><strong>Physical Description:</strong> A svirfneblin stands between 3 and
	3-1/2 feet tall and weighs between 40 and 45 pounds. He is wiry and lean, 
	with a body as hard as a slab of stone. His skin may be either mottled gray 
	or dun-colored (a good match for the rock around his home), and his eyes are 
	either dark gray or black. A female svirfneblin has hair the same color as 
	her eyes, but a male is entirely bald and beardless.</p>
	<p><strong>Relations:</strong> Gnomes are deeply suspicious of all other 
	races, particularly <a href="Drow.htm">drow</a> and kuo-toas. To a 
	svirfneblin, a stranger is an enemy, and the best way to deal with enemies 
	is to avoid them completely. Gnomes are most accepting of neutral or good 
	creatures such as gloamings, since these folk rarely threaten them. But they 
	deal very cautiously with quaggoths and <a href="Orogs.htm">orogs</a>, having learned that 
	members of these races are all too willing to plunder others who are too 
	weak to defend themselves. Svirfneblin traders take care to meet with 
	merchants of other races in neutral caverns that feature plenty of potential 
	exits, in case a deal goes sour.</p>
	<p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Svirfneblin believe that their survival 
	depends on avoiding entanglements with other races, so they strongly favor 
	neutral alignments. While they rarely wish others ill, neither are they 
	especially willing to take risks on behalf of others.</p>
	<p><strong>Religion:</strong> The svirfneblin venerate a god known as 
	Callarduran Smoothhands, the Master of Stone.</p>
	<p><strong>Adventurers:</strong> While most svirfneblin have little use for
	adventuring, they are without a doubt the best guides, scouts, and 
	pathfinders in the world. Quick, clever, and stealthy, svirfneblin have an 
	uncanny knack for finding their way through the bleak maze of caverns and 
	avoiding dangerous encounters along the way. A few svirfneblin find their 
	way into the adventuring life by serving as guides for parties composed of 
	other races.</p>
