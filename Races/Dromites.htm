<div class="wholedoc">
	<img class="a" width="210px" style="padding-top: 30px" src="Dromite.jpg"/><h1>Dromites</h1>
	<p>Dromites might be mistaken for gnomes or goblins at a distance, due to 
	their diminutive stature. However, closer scrutiny reveals dromites to have 
	hardened, chitin-encrusted skin, compound eyes like those of an insect, and 
	two small antennae protruding from their brows. Called “bugs” by the 
	ignorant, dromites share far more traits with other humanoids than they do 
	with insects. One major difference between dromites and most other races is 
	their androgynous physiology. Aside from their Queen (female) and their 
	Consort (male), dromites are genderless and possess no sexual 
	characteristics.</p>
	<p><strong>Personality:</strong> Dromites vary in their temperament, but 
	each usually exhibits one of four personality types, depending on the caste 
	that dromite eventually joins. Those of the Fire Caste are often quick to 
	anger, but also quick to laugh and forgive. Those of the Ice Caste are 
	analytical, slow to make decisions, but often right. Those of the Voice 
	Caste are consummate artists, reveling in all types of performance, 
	especially song. Those of the Glimmer Caste always move at high speed, 
	rarely resting in their pursuit of life's tasks. Each caste identifies with 
	the energy type associated with its creed: fire, cold, sonic, and 
	electricity, respectively.</p>
	<p>The four major castes are important to dromites, but are not the race's 
	only form of social organization. Despite being a sexless society, dromites 
	form close emotional bonds with others of their race, especially within the 
	confines of self-selected groups known as life bonds. These relationships 
	are similar to what other races refer to as marriages, but a life bond 
	usually contains more than two members. As older members of a life bond die, 
	new members are brought in, so a life bond persists long after the original 
	members are no longer a part of it. A single life bond may contain members 
	of several castes.</p>
	<p><strong>Physical Description:</strong> Dromites stand about 3 feet tall. 
	They are essentially humanoid in appearance, if a bit thin. Their chitinous 
	skin provides dromites with some protection against injury. Dromites have no 
	body hair; where a humanoid might possess a head of hair, a dromite has a 
	thin coating of convoluted chitin that smoothly rises from its skin and 
	extends down the back of its head, neck, and the rest of its body. Dromites 
	are not fully covered in chitin, but it is noticeable on their shoulders, 
	torsos, the backs of their hands, and other vulnerable spots (including 
	their heads).</p>
	<p>A dromite's eyes are striking—sparkling, almost luminescent orbs, 
	subdivided into hundreds of tiny cells. Two small antennae sprout from its 
	head; they move in accordance with the creature's actions or moods. They 
	wear heavy boots and light clothing, sometimes nothing more than a sturdy 
	harness for holding and carrying gear.</p>
	<p><strong>Dromite Society:</strong> Dromite hives can be found anywhere in 
	the world, but are usually secret and have only a few openings. Since 
	dromites are naturally psionic and adherents of the psionic arts (especially 
	psychokinesis), some hives have no physical outlets to surrounding 
	tunnels—dromites use permanent psionic portals and psionic powers to get 
	into and out of these most secure hives.</p>
	<p>Each dromite hive contains at least one Queen with female 
	characteristics, and one Consort with male characteristics. Both queen and 
	consort are elected on a yearly basis. After participating in a special 
	communal ceremony, they take on titular leadership roles and assume their 
	gender characteristics. Their most important responsibility is to provide a 
	year's worth of dromite eggs, which hatch in well-guarded nurseries. From 
	the eggs come dromite infants, which look more or less like most humanoid 
	infants (except that they have antennae).</p>
	<p><strong>Relations:</strong> Dromites are secretive and paranoid, and see 
	most other races as a threat to their communities. They get along well with
	<a href="Svirfneblin.htm">gnomes</a>, and several dromite hives can 
	sometimes be found in the vicinity of hidden gnome cities. They are happy to 
	trade with <a href="Ratfolk.htm">ratfolk</a> and also maintain cautious 
	trade relations with the <a href="Duergar">duergar</a>, though they are wary 
	of duergar slavers.</p>
	<p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Dromites tend toward no particular alignment, 
	not even neutral. The best and the worst are found among them.</p>
	<p><strong>Religion:</strong> Dromites are not particularly religious. They 
	hold their communities and especially their Queen and Consort in highest 
	regard, and some of their community rituals have the appearance of religious 
	observations.</p>
	<p><strong>Adventurers:</strong> Dromites who are curious about life beyond 
	the hive have little trouble securing permission to venture forth and seek 
	their fortunes. Excess population in a hive leads to cramped quarters, so 
	sometimes even the less than willing are pushed out into the world, on a 
	mission not of their choosing.</p>
