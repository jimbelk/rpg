<div class="wholedoc">
	<img class="a" width="215px" src="Kobold.jpg"/><h1>Kobolds</h1>
	<p>Kobolds are weak, craven, and seethe with a festering resentment for the 
	rest of the world, especially members of races that seem stronger, smarter, 
	or superior to them in any way. They proudly claim kinship to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Dragon">dragons</a>, 
	but beneath all the bluster, the comparison to their glorious cousins leaves 
	kobolds with a profound sense of inadequacy. Though they are hardworking, 
	clever, and blessed with a natural talent for mechanical devices and mining, 
	they spend their days nursing grudges and hatreds instead of celebrating 
	their own gifts. Kobold tactics specialize in traps and ambushes, but 
	kobolds enjoy anything that allows them to harm others without putting 
	themselves at risk. Often, they seek to capture rather than to kill, taking 
	out their frustrations on the helpless victims they drag back to their 
	claustrophobic lairs.</p>
	<p><strong>Physical Description:</strong> Kobolds are small, bipedal 
	reptilian humanoids. Most stand around 3 feet tall and weigh about 35 
	pounds. They have powerful jaws for creatures of their size and noticeable 
	claws on their hands and feet. Often kobolds' faces are curiously devoid of 
	expression, as they favor showing their emotions by simply swishing their 
	tails. Kobolds' thick hides vary in color, with orange or brown scales being 
	predominant.</p>
	<p><strong>Society:</strong> Kobolds live in vast warrens with huge 
	populations. Saving their malice for other races, most kobolds get along 
	well with their own kind. While squabbles and feuds do occur, the elders who 
	rule kobold communities tend to settle such conflicts swiftly. Kobolds 
	delight in taking slaves, relishing the chance to torment and humiliate 
	them. They are also cowardly and practical, and often end up bowing to more 
	powerful beings such as <a href="Drow.htm">drow</a>. Enslaved kobolds often 
	scheme to free themselves from subjugation as soon as possible. If the 
	overlord is a powerful draconic or monstrous creature, however, kobolds see 
	no shame in submission, and often shower adoration on their new leader. This 
	is especially true if the kobolds serve a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/dragons/dragon">dragon</a>, 
	who they tend to worship outright.</p>
	<p><strong>Relations:</strong> Kobolds often seethe with hatred and 
	jealousy, but their innate caution ensures that they only act on these 
	impulses when they have the upper hand. If unable to safely indulge their 
	urge to physically harm and degrade members of other races, they resort to 
	careful insults and “practical jokes” instead. They consider both&nbsp;<a href="Duergar.htm">duergar</a> 
	and <a href="Drow.htm">drow</a> to be deadly rivals, and they regard the
	<a href="Svifrneblin.htm">gnomes</a> as perfect victims. Huge numbers of
	<a href="Kobold.htm">kobolds</a> are kept as slaves in <a href="Drow.htm">
	drow</a> cities, but the <a href="Duergar.htm">duergar</a> are not fond of 
	kobold slaves, preferring <a href="Goblins.htm">goblins</a> and
	<a href="Orogs.htm">orcs</a>.</p>
	<p><strong>Alignment and Religion:</strong> Kobolds readily knuckle under to 
	superior force but rarely stop scheming to gain an edge over their 
	oppressors. Most kobolds are lawful evil, though some, more concerned with 
	procedure than their own personal advantage, become lawful neutral instead. 
	Kobolds worship Kurtulmank, a kobold deity who is a vassal of Tiamat.</p>
	<p><strong>Adventurers:</strong> Kobolds rarely leave their cozy warrens by 
	their own choice. Most of those who set out on adventures are the last of 
	their tribe, and such individuals often settle down again as soon as they 
	find another kobold community willing to take them in. Kobolds who cannot 
	rein in, or at least conceal, their spiteful and malicious natures have 
	great difficulty surviving in the larger world. </p>
