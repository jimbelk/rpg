<div class="wholedoc">
	<h1>Yugoloths<strong><img height="330%" src="Yugoloths.png" style="float: right" width="45%"></strong></h1>
	<p>The <strong>yugoloths</strong> (also known as <strong>daemons</strong>) 
	are a race of neutral evil fiends.&nbsp; They are the third most powerful 
	race of fiends, neither as numerous and destructive as the tanar'ri (<strong>demons</strong>), 
	nor as ambitious and organized as the baatezu (<strong>devils</strong>).&nbsp; 
	The yugoloths officially remain neutral in the eternal <strong>Blood War</strong> 
	between the demons and the devils, though yugoloth armies fight for both 
	sides as mercenaries.</p>
	<p>The yugoloths originate in the <strong>Gray Waste of Hades </strong>(one 
	of the seven lower planes), but most of the race long ago moved to the
	<strong>Bleak Eternity of Gehenna</strong>. The ruler of the yugoloths is an 
	ancient ultroloth known only as <strong>The General</strong>.&nbsp; He rules 
	Gehenna from the <strong>Crawling City</strong>, a giant metropolis with 
	huge demonic legs that literally crawls across the plane. The Crawling City 
	has massive factories that manufacture an endless supply of terrible weapons 
	for the Blood War, as well as a war academy where creatures from all across 
	the multiverse come to learn military strategy.&nbsp; The yugoloths also 
	maintain a fortress in Hades known as <strong>Khin-Oin</strong> (also known 
	as the <strong>Wasting Tower</strong>), which is said to have been fashioned 
	from the spinal column of a slain deity, and whose ruler the <strong>
	Oinoloth</strong> is the nominal ruler of all of Hades.&nbsp; Many other 
	yugoloths live on or near the <strong>River Styx</strong> that flows through 
	all of the lower planes.</p>
	<p>Most yugoloths are primarily interested in enhancing their own power, 
	though they also take a certain glee in hurting others. Many yugoloths serve 
	as mercenaries in both sides of the Blood War, as well as in many other wars 
	across the multiverse.&nbsp; Though they are fierce warriors and brutal 
	strategists, they also have a reputation for disloyalty, and any yugoloth 
	can be convinced to turn on his masters for the right price. Yugoloths are 
	also renowned as torturers, owing to their natural talent for inflicting 
	pain and misery.</p>
	<p>Yugoloths typically speak Abyssal, Draconic, and Infernal, and can also 
	communicate telepathically. All yugoloths are immune to acid and poison and 
	have resistance 10 against cold, electricity, and fire. They have spell 
	resistance as well as damage reduction (typically DR/good).</p>
	<h2>Some Types of Yugoloths</h2>
	<p>
	<img class="auto-style1" height="206" src="Mezzoloth.jpg" style="float: left" width="150"><strong><a name="Merrenoloths"></a></strong>The 
	bulk of the yugoloth population is made up of <strong>mezzoloths</strong>, 
	which are human-sized insect creatures covered in dense chitinous plates. 
	Mezzoloths serve as foot soldiers in yugoloth armies, their wide-set eyes 
	glowing yellow as the mezzoloths bear down on their foes. Violence and reward 
	are the fundamental drives of a mezzoloth, and powerful beings that promise 
	one or the other can easily attract them into service. If surrounded by 
	enemies, a mezzoloth exhales toxic fumes that can choke and kill whole 
	groups of creatures.</p>
	<p>
	<strong>Dhergoloths</strong><a name="Kuo-Toa"></a><img src="Dhergoloth.png" style="float: right" width="180"> 
	rush into battle like whirlwinds of destruction, lashing out with five sets 
	of claws, which extend from their squat, barrel-shaped bodies. They take 
	contracts to put down uprisings, clear out rabble, and eliminate scouts and 
	skirmishers, and they revel in the butchery they create, their unhinged 
	laughter rising above their victims' screams. Since dhergoloths are little 
	more than dumb brutes, employers must use caution when instructing these 
	fiends. They can handle simple orders that don't take a lot of time to 
	resolve. When given anything complex to do, they either forget what they're 
	told or don't listen in the first place, and then bungle the task that was 
	set for them.</p>
	<p>
	<img class="auto-style1" src="Piscoloth.png" style="float: left" width="170">Sergeants 
	and overseers of the yugoloth armies, <strong>piscoloths</strong> hold 
	dictatorial sway over companies of lesser yugoloths. The fish-tailed, 
	walleyed piscoloth has the red, chitinous body of a lobster, the talons 
	of a bird, and the head of a carrion crawler. The piscoloth’s arms, though 
	humanoid, end in a set of crablike pincers. Cruel, hateful bullies, 
	piscoloths keep order in the yugoloth armies—a task well suited to their 
	petty and tyrannical demeanor.</p>
	<p>
	<img src="Hydroloth.jpg" style="float: right" width="200">Like the 
	thought-stealing waters of the River Styx they inhabit, <strong>hydroloths</strong> 
	filch the memories of creatures they attack, stealing away their thoughts 
	for delivery to whatever master they happen to serve. Hydroloths are skilled 
	at finding lost things, especially those that have been swallowed up in the 
	deeps. For amphibious assaults or underwater conflicts, hydroloths have no 
	equal among yugoloths.</p>
	<p>
	<img class="auto-style1" src="Merrenoloth.jpg" style="float: left" width="160"><strong><a name="Grell"></a></strong>The 
	grim, gaunt captains of the ferries on the River Styx, <strong>merrenoloths</strong> 
	have total command of their vessels, ensuring that their passengers reach 
	their destinations safely. Sometimes merrenoloths can be coaxed away from 
	the Lower Planes to captain other vessels, affording those ships and crews 
	the same protection. Whenever a merrenoloth takes on a contract to captain a 
	ship, it bonds with the vehicle to make sure nothing goes awry with it 
	during the journey. A merrenoloth always stays on course, and never runs 
	afoul of the myriad hazards that can thwart lesser captains.</p>
	<p>
	<img src="Nycaloth.jpg" style="float: right" width="300"><strong><a name="Mites"></a></strong>The 
	elite airborne shock troops of the yugoloths, <strong>nycaloths</strong> 
	look like muscular gargoyles. Powerful bat wings bear them swiftly aloft in 
	battle, and the razor-sharp claws of their hands and feet cut through flesh 
	and bone with ease. A nightmarish foe, a nycaloth strikes hard and fast 
	without warning, then teleports away. It uses its innate magic to turn 
	invisible or create illusory doubles of itself, further confounding its 
	enemies. Nycaloths are the most loyal of the yugoloths. When they find an 
	evil master that treats them well, they are unlikely to break their 
	agreement unless the reward for doing so is extreme.</p>
	<p>
	<img class="auto-style1" src="Arcanaloth.jpg" style="float: left" width="180"><strong>Arcanaloths</strong> 
	are sly, jackal-headed beings with humanoid bodies, but they can employ 
	magic to take any humanoid form. They do so to gain the trust of creatures 
	with whom they negotiate, replacing jackal snarls with winsome smiles. 
	Regardless of its chosen form, an arcanaloth appears well groomed, clothing 
	itself in fine robes. Highly intelligent spellcasters who hunger for 
	knowledge and power, arcanaloths command units of lesser yugoloths and 
	maintain the contracts, records, and accounts of their kind..</p>
	<p>
	<img src="Ultroloth.gif" style="float: right" width="250"><strong>Ultroloths</strong> 
	are commanders of yugoloth armies. An ultroloth looks like a slender 
	gray-skinned humanoid with an elongated head. Its face bears no features 
	except for two ovoid eyes. These eyes can become sparkling pools of light 
	that can transfix other creatures and leave them reeling and helpless. 
	Frequently at one another's throats, ultroloths continually scheme to 
	enhance their own power. When not employed to fight in a war, ultroloths 
	lead yugoloth forces throughout the planes, acting as crime bosses or 
	commanders of evil mercenary companies.</p>
	<p>
	<strong>
	<img class="auto-style1" src="Baernaloth.png" style="float: left" width="200"><a name="Dark Ones"></a>Baernoloths</strong> 
	are legendary fiends from the Gray Waste of Hades, as devoid of emotion and 
	color as the plane itself and among the multiverse's biggest enigmas. 
	Baernaloths intentionally isolated themselves from yugoloth society, having 
	long since vanished into the Gray Wastes and making no efforts to migrate to 
	Gehenna with most other yugoloths. They live as hermits, making lairs within 
	towers so twisted and desolate that even denizens of Hades would find them 
	menacing. It is rumored that the baernoloths are the most ancient of all 
	fiends and that they created the other yugoloths as well as the demons and 
	devils. A baernoloth's plans, schemes, and agendas can span thousands of 
	years, and scholars have suggested that their ultimate goal is the 
	annihilation of all reality. </p>
