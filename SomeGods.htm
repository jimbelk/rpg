	<h1>Important Gods</h1>
	<h2><img height="330%" src="StCuthbert.jpg" style="float: right" width="50%" class="auto-style16">St. Cuthbert</h2>
	<p>St. Cuthbert, also known as the<strong> Blind God</strong>, the<strong> 
	Maimed God</strong>, or the <strong>Hand of Justice</strong>, is a lawful good deity of law and justice.&nbsp; His 
	dogma concerns the protection of the innocent, punishment of wrong-doers, 
	and the preservation of good in the world.</p>
	<p>The cult of St. Cuthbert is a secret organization known as the Unseen.&nbsp;Historically, members of the Unseen have been instrumental in organizing the 
	duergar, drow, and svirfneblin to fight against the mind flayers and 
	aboleths, as well as extraplanar threats including demons, devils, and 
	creatures from the far realm. More recently the Unseen have maintained their 
	vigilance against these threats while simultaneously working to stabilize 
	the political situation and combat more mundane threats such as the 
	gibberlings and the derro. </p>

	<h2><a href="Gods/Lolth.htm"><img height="330%" src="Lolth.png" style="float: left" width="35%" class="auto-style16">Lolth</a></h2>
	<p><a href="Gods/Lolth.htm">Lolth</a>, also known as the <strong>Spider Queen </strong>or the <strong>
	Dark Mother</strong>, is a chaotic evil 
	deity of spiders and drow. She is the most powerful deity of the drow 
	pantheon and demands absolute loyalty from her followers.&nbsp; Drow society 
	is domainated by the priestesses of <a href="Gods/Lolth.htm">Lolth</a>, who fight each other for her 
	favor, and drow culture is entirely consumed by their worship of the 
	goddess.</p>
	<p><a href="Gods/Lolth.htm">Lolth</a> thrives on death, destruction, and torture.&nbsp; She is not loved 
	by the drow&mdash;they fear her power, and live their lives in terror of 
	displeasing her. All drow are taught to fear and praise 
	<a href="Gods/Lolth.htm">Lolth</a> from a young 
	age, and all families are expected to produce at least one cleric for the 
	goddess.&nbsp; <a href="Gods/Lolth.htm">Lolth</a> teaches that the strong shall survive while the soft 
	and weak shall perish, and she encourages the drow to cull the weak as well 
	as those not wholly dedicated to her. <a href="Gods/Lolth.htm">Lolth</a> has a special fondness for 
	spiders, and harming a spider is punishable by death in drow society.</p>
	<br>
	<h2><img height="330%" src="Laduguer.jpg" style="float: right" width="25%" class="auto-style16">Laduguer</h2>
	<p>Laduguer, also known as the<strong> Gray Protector</strong>,<strong>
	</strong>is the lawful evil duergar god of domination, hardship, servitiude, 
	and toil. His dogma concerns strict obedience to superiors, empowerment 
	through the exploitation of slaves, and enrichment through mining, 
	craftsmanship, and conquest.</p>
	<p>Temples of Laduguer are grim, smoke-filled halls constructed from solid 
	rock.&nbsp; They are often decorated with weapons and armor and double as 
	forges. Non-duergar are not allowed in the temples, although clerics are 
	willing to provide spellcasting services to non-dwarves in front of a temple 
	for reasonable prices. Laduguer views worship and praise as useless 
	luxuries, and his clerics are expected to spend most of their time working 
	as craftsman, running businesses, or otherwise enriching themselves and 
	increasing the power of the duergar.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h2><img height="330%" src="YChak.jpg" style="float: left" width="40%" class="auto-style16">Y'Chak</h2>
	<p>Y'Chak, also known as the <strong>Violet Flame</strong>, is not actually 
	a god, but a different kind of being sometimes called an <strong>outer god</strong> 
	or <strong>elder evil</strong>. Aboleths believe that the elder evils are 
	older than the gods&mdash;older perhaps than the universe itself&mdash;and 
	will continue to exist long after the universe has come to an end. The elder 
	evils are alien and unknowable, operating with motives that mortals can't 
	possibly fathom.</p>
	<p>Unlike most elder evils, Y'Chak active communicates with mortals through 
	terrible nightmares and premonitions.&nbsp; He is worshipped by the 
	aboleths, who regard Y'Chak as the personification of entropy.&nbsp; 
	According to the aboleths, Y'Chak seeks to move all life towards 
	destruction, madness, and ruin.</p>
	<p>The mind flayers seem to believe that Y'Chak was somehow involved in the 
	massive invasion of the world by far realm creatures nearly four centuries 
	ago. Due to subtle manipulation by the aboleths, the mind flayers mistakenly 
	opened a portal to Y'Chak's domain, leading to a huge influx of bizarre 
	aberrations such as cloakers, gibbering mouthers, and gugs. This ended the 
	Awakening War between the mind flayers and their former slaves as all 
	parties joined together to fight the aberrations.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h2><img height="330%" src="YogSothoth.png" style="float: right" width="40%" class="auto-style16">Yog-Sothoth</h2>
	<p>Yog-Sothoth, also known as the <strong>Eater of Souls</strong>, is a 
	completely alien elder evil who lives in the space between the stars, or perhaps beyond them 
	altogether. The aboleths view Yog-Sothoth as the personification of the void&mdash;the 
	nothingness from which the universe sprung and to which it will one day 
	return.&nbsp; According to the aboleths, Yog-Sothoth seeks the dissolution 
	of reality itself and the negation of all existence.</p>
	<p>The cult of Yog-Sothoth works to hasten the world's demise, which they 
	believe they can accomplish by contacting their outer god.&nbsp; The nature 
	and organization of the cult are mysterious, but dark whispers tell of a<strong> 
	Triad </strong>of powerful spellcasters who maintain a hidden fortress on 
	the Astral plane. The cult is 
	opposed by the Unseen, who through repeated attacks have weakened the cult 
	and ruined their designs.</p>
