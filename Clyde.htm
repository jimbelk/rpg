		SPECIAL ABILITIES</h4>
	<h4 class="bluebar">Trick Attack (Ex), Debilitating Trick (Ex), Staggering 
	Trick&nbsp;(Ex)</h4><p>Clyde can trick or startle a foe and then attack when she drops her 
		guard. As a full action, he can move up to his speed. (If he chooses the 
		target of his trick attack before he moves, then his movement does not 
		provoke attacks of opportunity from that target.) Whether or not he 
		moved, he can then make an attack. Just before making his attack, 
		he attempts a Bluff, Intimidate, or Stealth check (with a +1&nbsp;bonus if a 
		Stealth check).</p>
	<p class="auto-style5"><strong>Trick Attack DC</strong> = 20 + target's CR</p>
	<p>If he succeeds at the check, the target is flat-footed against the 
	attack, suffering a −2 penalty to&nbsp;AC (see&nbsp;<a href="https://paizo.com/starfinder/faq#v5748eaic9vwk">FAQ</a>). 
	If the attack succeeds, he deals 4d8 additional damage and the 
	target suffers one of the following conditions (Clyde's choice):</p>
	<p class="auto-style5"><strong>Flat-footed:</strong> The target takes a −2 
	penalty to&nbsp;AC and cannot take reactions until the beginning of Clyde's next 
	turn.</p>
	<p class="auto-style5"><strong>Off-target:</strong>&nbsp;The target takes a 
	−2 penalty to attack rolls until the beginning of Clyde's next turn.</p>
	<p class="auto-style5"><strong>Staggered:</strong>&nbsp;The target must make 
	a <span title="10 + 1/2 operative level + Dex modifier" class="auto-style3">
	DC&nbsp;17</span> Fortitude save or be staggered until the beginning of Clyde's 
	next turn. A staggered creature can take a single move action or standard 
	action each round, but not both, nor can it take full actions. It can still 
	take swift actions, but not reactions. Once Clyde has used this ability to 
	attempt to stagger a creature, that creature is immune to Clyde's staggering 
	shot for 24 hours. </p>
	<p>Clyde can only use this ability with a melee weapon that has the operative 
	special property or with any small arm. Clyde can’t use this ability with a weapon that has the unwieldy 
	special property or that requires a full action to make a single attack. </p>
	<p><strong>Note:</strong> The extra damage from a trick attack is doubled on 
	a critical hit. See
	<a href="https://www.aonsrd.com/WeaponCriticals.aspx?ItemName=All">here</a>.</p>
	<h4 class="bluebar"><a name="Holographic-Clone"></a>Holographic Clone (Ex)</h4>
		<p>Clyde can create holographic duplicates of himself that conceal his 
		true location. Twice per day as a standard action, he can create 1d4 
		images of himself that last for
		<span title="1 minute per operative level" class="auto-style3">7&nbsp;minutes</span>.</p>
	<p>This ability otherwise functions as&nbsp;<em>mirror image</em>.&nbsp; In 
	particular, these images remain in Clyde's space and move with him, 
	mimicking his movements, sounds, and actions exactly. Whenever Clyde is 
	attacked or is the target of a spell that requires an attack roll, the 
	attack has the following result:</p>
	<p class="auto-style5"><strong>Attack hits:</strong> Roll randomly to see 
	whether the selected target is real or a hologram. If it is a hologram, the 
	hologram is destroyed.</p>
	<p class="auto-style5"><strong>Attack misses by 5 or less:</strong> One of 
	the holograms is destroyed by the near miss.</p>
	<p class="auto-style5"><strong>Attack misses due to a miss chance:</strong> 
	Also destroys an image.</p>
	<p>Area spells and effects that don’t require an attack roll affect Clyde 
	normally and don’t destroy any of his holograms. Spells with a range of 
	touch are harmlessly discharged if used to destroy a hologram.</p>
	<p>An attacker must be able to see the holograms to be fooled. If Clyde is 
	invisible or the attacker is blind, the holograms have no effect. Blindsense 
	doesn’t help distinguish the holograms from the real Clyde, but blindsight 
	is sufficient to do so. </p>
	<h4 class="bluebar"><a name="Cloaking-Field"></a>Cloaking Field (Ex)</h4>
		<p>Clyde can bend light around himelf and muffle any minor sounds he 
		makes, allowing him to nearly vanish when not moving. Even when he 
		moves, he appears only as an outline with blurry features. This cloaking 
		field doesn’t make him invisible, but it does make it easier for him to 
		sneak around. Activating the cloaking field is a move action. While the 
		cloaking field is active, Clyde can use Stealth to hide, even while 
		being directly observed and with no place to hide. Attacking doesn’t end 
		the cloaking field, but it does end that particular attempt to hide. If 
		he remains perfectly still for at least 1 round, he gains a +10&nbsp;bonus to 
		Stealth checks (which doesn’t stack with invisibility) until he moves.</p>
	<p>Clyde's cloaking field lasts for up to 10 rounds before it becomes 
	inactive. While inactive, the cloaking field recharges automatically at the 
	rate of 1&nbsp;round of cloaking per minute.</p>
