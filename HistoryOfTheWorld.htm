	<h2><a name="1-Ancient-History"></a>1. Ancient History</h2>
	<p>Very little is known about the history of the world before the 
	Awakening.&nbsp; It is known that, in the preceding century, a series of 
	cataclysmic events left most of the cities of the world in ruins, including 
	an apparent extraplanar invasion by a horde of fiends (both demons and 
	devils). Very few written records survive from that time, though many of the 
	largest dungeons of the world date back to that period.</p>
	<p>The ruins on the surface are much older (by several thousand years), and 
	clearly indicate the existence of an ancient surface civilization. The 
	nature of this civilization is a complete mystery, as is its eventual fate. 
	Some sages have speculated that this may have been the original home plane 
	of the githyanki and githzerai, before the arrival of the illithids, while 
	others have argued that the surface was populated by some unknown progenitor 
	race, perhaps a common ancestor of xephs, duergar, urdinnir, drow, and 
	svirfneblin. </p>
	<h2><a name="2-Extinct-Races"></a>2. Extinct Races</h2>
	<p>Two extinct races play an important role in the history of the world: the 
	xephs and the urdunnir.</p>
	<p>The xephs (or humans) were a tall and skinny race, about a foot taller 
	than a typical dwarf.&nbsp;Their skin was smooth and light brown, and they only 
	rarely wore facial hair. Xephs were among the most flexible of all races, 
	with wizards and clerics as powerful as the greatest elf, and fighters and 
	psychic warriors as strong as the best dwarf.</p>
	<p>The urdunnir were an offshoot of the dwarven race. In addition to the 
	usual beards, they had grey hair on top of their heads, and silvery eyes.&nbsp; 
	The urdinnir were not as cruel as their duergar cousins, though they shared 
	the same love of mining and craftsmanship. The urdinnir did not possess 
	psionic powers, and some scholars believe that the illithids bred the 
	duergar from urdinnir stock sometime before the Awakening. </p>
	<h2><a name="3-Awakening-War"></a>3. Awakening War (1&ndash;97 P.A.)</h2>
	<p>Immediately after the Awakening, the &ldquo;grand alliance&rdquo; of xephs, duergar, 
	urdinnir, drow, and svirfneblin fought fiercely against the illithids, 
	destroying all of their cities in the Middleworld as well as many of their 
	great machines. This alliance was fragile, however, as the duergar and drow 
	were greedy to claim territory for themselves, while urdinnir and 
	svirfneblin were distrustful of other races.</p>
	<p>The xephs were natural leaders of the alliance, for they had a talent for 
	diplomacy, and managed to rally all of the other races to their cause. This 
	proved disastrous for them, for it made the elimination of the xephs the 
	foremost goal of the illithids. In 23&nbsp;P.A., the illithids unleashed the 
	Purge, a storm of psionic energy that spread through the world, completely 
	eradicating the xephs as well as several minor races.</p>
	<p>Following the loss of the xephs, the alliance fractured, with each race 
	making war on the illithids separately.&nbsp; Soon conflicts over captured 
	territory (as well as the former territory of the xephs) led to open warfare 
	between the duergar and the drow.</p>
	<p>This led to a period (roughly 23 P.A. &ndash; 97 P.A.) of intermittent 
	warfare between all the major races.&nbsp; The duergar and urdinnir continued 
	their fight against the illithids, but also had to contend with the drow, 
	who seemed determined to claim the Middleworld for themselves.&nbsp; During this 
	time, the svirfneblin began to lose interest in war, and hid themselves in 
	increasingly fortified cities.</p>
	<h2><a name="4-Far-Realm-Invasion"></a>4. Far Realm Invasion (97&ndash;139 
	P.A.)</h2>
	<p>In 97 P.A., the illithids opened a portal to a distant corner of the Far 
	Realm, an extraplanar space of pure madness. Hoping to summon allies, they 
	instead awoke a primordial alien intelligence known as Y'chak (the Violet 
	Flame).</p>
	<p>This was not entirely a coincidence: it was later found that the illithid 
	portal project had been subtly influenced by the aboleths, an ancient race 
	living in the deepest oceans of the Lowerworld. Apparently the aboleths 
	worship a collection of beings that they refer to as the &ldquo;Elder Evils&rdquo;, of 
	which Y'chak is one.</p>
	<p>For some unfathomable reason, Y'chak began to send horror after horror to 
	this world, including a large number of kaorti, grell, cloakers, gibbering 
	mouthers, and so forth. The laws of reality seemed to bend wherever the 
	newcomers would arrive, and great swaths of the world soon descended into 
	madness.</p>
	<p>Unable to fight this threat themselves, the illithids saught help from 
	their former enemies, and together the illithids, duergar, drow, and 
	urdinnir fought back the invaders. Eventually Y'chak seemed to turn his 
	attention elsewhere, and most of the Far Realm aberrations were slain. </p>
	<h2><a name="5-Peace-Of-Dunspeirrin"></a>5. Peace of Dunspeirrin (139&ndash;332 
	P.A.)</h2>
	<p>Following the war, the illithids made peace with their former slave 
	races. In the Treaty of Dunspeirrin (139 P.A.), the illithids granted their 
	former slaves control of the entire Middleworld, while retaining for 
	themselves the Lowerworld.</p>
	<p>This treaty led to a long period of relative peace, broken only by 
	occasional periods of unrest:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>In 163 P.A., the goblin cleric Gashkag united a large number of 
		goblin, bugbear, orc, ogre, and troll tribes under his command, and 
		began a war against the dwarven and elven civilizations. This war lasted 
		for seven years, but eventually the goblins were crushed.</li>
		<li>In 238 P.A., the drow queen Chandara united all of the drow houses, 
		and began a war of genocide against the duergar and urdinnir. The drow 
		captured several major dwarf cities, but the war ended unexpectedly when 
		Chandara was assassinated by the head of a rival house.</li>
		<li>In 311 P.A., the Great Horde of gibberlings swept through the world, 
		destroying everything in their wake. This menace fell most heavily upon 
		the urdinnir, who lost many of their greatest cities to the unstoppable 
		hordes. The origin of the gibberlings remains a mystery, though sages 
		have speculated that they may be extraplanar in origin, or perhaps they 
		may have been bred by the illithids. </li>
	</ul>
	<h2><a name="6-Devastation-War"></a>6. Devastation War (333&ndash;345 P.A.)</h2>
	<p>In 333 P.A., a party of adventurers discovered that the illithids were in 
	the process of reconstructing the thoughtstone, and intended to use it to 
	regain mental control of all inhabitants of the world.</p>
	<p>Shortly after this plot was exposed, the urdinnir completely disappeared 
	from the world.&nbsp; Caverns containing their largest remaining cities were 
	destroyed in great cave&#8209;ins, while smaller dwarf settlements were simply 
	abandoned.&nbsp; Though the illithids were initially blamed, it was later 
	revealed that the urdinnir had planned their disappearance, and had left 
	this world for some undisclosed extraplanar location.</p>
	<p>The remaining races immediately declared war against the illithids, and 
	began advancing their armies into the Lowerworld. What they found there 
	surprised them:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Illithid cities had grown considerably, and the illithid 
		civilization had spread throughout the Lowerworld. In addition, several 
		portals were discovered to domed illithid cities that had somehow been 
		constructed on the surface.</li>
		<li>The illithids had enslaved a new race that they had found in the 
		Lowerworld (now known as the grimlocks) and had bred them mercilessly. 
		The grimlocks proved quite fierce in battle, and provided much more 
		resistance than was expected to the advancing armies of dwarves and 
		elves.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>In addition to their armies of grimlocks, the illithids had another 
	weapon in their arsenal of enormous power, which they referred to as the 
	&ldquo;Vatholaunt&rdquo;. This weapon had been carefully constructed by the illithids 
	over the course of a century, and was the size of a small city. It had two 
	main effects:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>When activated, the Vatholaunt created a series of directed 
		earthquakes of terrible power. Over the course of a few weeks, the 
		illithids used these earthquakes to destroy most of the major drow and 
		duergar cities in the Middleworld.</li>
		<li>The weapon used an enormous amount of magical energy, which it 
		drained from the rest of the world. Following the first use of the 
		weapon, most magic items in the world temporarily ceased to function, 
		arcane and divine casters became entirely unable to cast spells, and 
		divine casters' prayers went unanswered.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>A few weeks into the war, most major dwarf and elf cities had been 
	leveled, the gnomes had been removed from the battlefield (with many of 
	their armies sealed into their inaccessible cities), and drow magic had been 
	rendered useless. </p>
	<p>Fortunately, the psionic powers of the dwarves were unaffected by the 
	loss of magic, and dwarf psions were successfully able to locate the 
	Vatholaunt.&nbsp; After a series of desperate military campaigns against grimlock 
	armies, one dwarven division managed to break through to the Lowerworld and 
	destroy the device.</p>
	<p>Following this success, the dwarves and elves waged a series of defensive 
	campaigns against the advancing armies of grimlocks. Over the course of a 
	year, the illithids managed to capture several major cities, including 
	Dunspeirrin, Menzoberranzan, Undrek'Thoz, Eryndlyn, and Gracklstugh.</p>
	<p>Roughly fourteen months after the war began, magic slowly started to work 
	again, with full magic being restored after another month or so. Suddenly 
	gnome armies became available, and the drow armies regained their 
	substantial might.&nbsp; Using this advantage, the dwarves and elves managed to 
	retake most of their greatest cities in a series of campaigns over the 
	course of twelve years, though a few still remain in the hands of the 
	illithids.</p>
	<h2><a name="7-Recent-History"></a>7. Recent History (345&ndash;461 P.A.)</h2>
	<p>At the end of the Devastation War, a drow lich cleric named Mi'zri siezed 
	control of the drow armies, and launched a surprise attack against the 
	dwarves. This led to a century-long series of wars between the dwarves and 
	the elves, which have severely weakened both civilizations. Some important 
	events during this time include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>In 372 P.A., the chitines (a race of spider people who had been 
		slaves of the drow) revolted, sacking several drow cities and severely 
		hobbling the drow military effort.&nbsp; The lich Mi'zri was killed during 
		this revolt.</li>
		<li>In 404 P.A., another horde of gibberlings swept through the world.&nbsp; 
		Though not as terrible as the Great Horde, they did considerable damage, 
		with the destruction falling most heavily on the duergar.</li>
		<li>In 428 P.A., for reasons that have still not been revealed, the 
		demon goddess Lolth worshipped by the drow suddenly stopped answering 
		prayers. The silence of Lolth lasted for approximately one year, and led 
		to major uphevals in drow society. Seizing upon this opportunity, the 
		dwarves launched a major attack against Menzoberranzan, leading to a 
		decade of war.</li>
		<li>In 442 P.A., drow worshippers of the mysterious &ldquo;Elder Elemental 
		Eye&rdquo; seized control of several major drow cities, and sent armies to 
		conquer both the duergar and the rest of drow civilization. These armies 
		were led by terrible creatures summoned from the Far Realm, which has 
		led some sages to speculate that the Elder Elemental Eye must somehow be 
		connected with one of the Elder Evils. This drow civil war lasted for 
		seven years, but the worshippers of elemental evil were finally defeated 
		by the armies of Lolth.</li>
		<li>In 451 P.A., the drow discovered the location of the gnome city of 
		Blingdenstone and promptly destroyed&nbsp;it. If anything, this has increased 
		the gnomes' paranoia, and gnome travelers and merchants have become 
		rarer and rarer over the last decade.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Throughout these wars, the illithids have been largely silent, with the 
	exception of the occasional raid for slaves or food. Presumably they have 
	been rebuilding their forces, and perhaps constructing some other terrible 
	weapon. With the dwarves, elves, and gnomes at each other's throats, the 
	time seems ripe for an illithid conquest of the Middleworld. </p>
