	SPECIAL ABILITIES</h4>
		<h4 class="bluebar"><a name="Lay-On-Hands"></a>Lay on Hands (Su) - 4d6, 
		11/day, Mercies: Sickened, Dazed</h4>
	<p>Dyllon can heal wounds (his own or those of others) by touch.&nbsp; With 
	one use of this ability, Dyllon can heal 4d6 hit points of damage.&nbsp; In 
	addition, the target of Dyllon's lay on hands is no longer sickened or 
	dazed.&nbsp; If either of these conditions was caused by a curse, disease, 
	or poison, the lay on hands does not actually cure the affliction, but the 
	condition is suppressed for 1 hour after the lay on hands is used.</p>
	<p>Using this ability is a standard action, unless Dyllon targets himself, 
	in which case it is a swift action. Despite the name of this ability, Dyllon 
	only needs one free hand to use this ability.</p>
	<p>Alternatively, Dyllon can use this healing power to deal damage to undead 
	creatures, dealing 4d6 points of damage. Using lay on hands in this way 
	requires a successful melee touch attack and doesn't provoke an&nbsp;<a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-attacks-of-opportunity">attack 
	of opportunity</a>. Undead do not receive a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws">saving 
	throw</a>&nbsp;against this damage. </p>
	<h4 class="bluebar"><a name="Power-Of-Faith"></a>Power of Faith (Su)</h4>
		<p>Dyllon can spend a use of his lay on hands ability to call upon the 
		power of his faith as a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard 
		action</a>. This causes a nimbus of light to emanate from him in a 
		30-foot radius. All allies in this area (including Dyllon) receive a +1&nbsp;<a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Morale-Bonus">morale 
		bonus</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-armor-Class">AC</a>&nbsp;and 
		on attack rolls, damage rolls, and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws">saving 
		throws</a>&nbsp;against fear as long as they remain in the area of light. 
		This power lasts for 1 minute.</p>
	<h4 class="bluebar"><a name="Channel-Positive-Energy"></a>Channel Positive 
	Energy (Su) - 4d6</h4>
		<p>Dyllon can spend two use of his lay on hands ability to channel 
		positive energy. This causes a burst that affects all creatures of one 
		type (either&nbsp;<a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a>&nbsp;or 
		living) in a 30-foot radius centered on the Dyllon, either dealing or 
		healing 4d6 poitns of damage. Creatures that take damage from channeled 
		energy receive a DC 19&nbsp;<a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a>&nbsp;save 
		to halve the damage (the save DC is Charisma-based). Creatures healed by 
		channel energy cannot exceed their maximum hit point total—all excess 
		healing is lost. This is a standard action that does not provoke an 
		attack of opportunity. Dyllon can choose whether or not to include 
		himself in this effect. </p>
	<h4 class="bluebar"><a name="Detect-Evil"></a>Detect Evil (Sp)</h4>
		<p>At will, Dyllon can use&nbsp;<a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/detect-evil">detect 
		evil</a>, as the spell. Dyllon can, as a move action, concentrate on a 
		single item or individual within 60 feet and determine if it is evil, 
		learning the strength of its aura as if having studied it for 3 rounds. 
		While focusing on one individual or object, the paladin does not detect 
		evil in any other object or individual within range. </p>
	<h4 class="bluebar"><a name="Smite-Evil"></a>Smite Evil (Su) - 3/day</h4>
		<p>Three times per day, Dyllon can call out to the powers of good to aid 
		him in his struggle against evil. As a swift action, Dyllon chooses one 
		target within sight to smite. If this target is evil, he adds his Cha<a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-"><span class="auto-style3">
		</span></a>bonus (+5) to his attack rolls and +8 to all damage rolls 
		made against the target of his smite. If the target of smite evil is an 
		outsider with the evil subtype, an evil-aligned dragon, or an undead 
		creature, the bonus to damage on the first successful attack increases 
		to +16. Regardless of the target, smite evil attacks automatically 
		bypass any&nbsp;<a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-damage-reduction">DR</a>&nbsp;the 
		creature might possess.</p>
	<p>In addition, while smite evil is in effect, Dyllon gains a deflection 
	bonus equal to his&nbsp;<a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>&nbsp;modifier 
	(+5) to his&nbsp;<a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Armor-Class">AC</a>&nbsp;against 
	attacks made by the target of the smite. If Dyllon targets a creature that 
	is not evil, the smite is wasted with no effect.</p>
	<p>The smite evil effect remains until the target of the smite is dead or 
	the next time Dyllon rests and regains his uses of this ability. </p>
	<h4 class="bluebar"><a name="Aura-Of-Courage"></a>Aura of Courage and 
	Resolve (Su)</h4>
		<p>Each ally within 10 feet of Dyllon gains a +4 morale bonus on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws">saving 
		throws</a>&nbsp;against fear and charm effects. This ability functions only 
		while Dyllon is conscious, not if he is&nbsp;<a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious">unconscious</a>&nbsp;or 
		dead.</p>
	<h4 class="bluebar"><a name="Divine-Bond"></a>Divine Bond (Sp)</h4>
		<p>Once per day as a standard action, Dyllon can enhance his weapon by 
		calling upon the aid of a celestial spirit for 8 minutes. When called, 
		the spirit causes the weapon to shed light as a torch, and grants the 
		weapon a +2 enhancement bonus. This bonus can be added to the weapon, 
		stacking with existing weapon bonuses to a maximum of +5, or it can be 
		used to add any of the following weapon properties:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/axiomatic">axiomatic</a> 
		(+2),
		<a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/defending">
		defending</a> (+1),
		<a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/disruption">
		disruption</a> (+2),&nbsp;<a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/flaming">flaming</a> 
		(+1),&nbsp;<a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/flaming-burst">flaming 
		burst</a> (+2),&nbsp;<a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/holy">holy</a> 
		(+2),&nbsp;<a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/keen">keen</a> 
		(+1), and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/merciful">merciful</a> 
		(+1). These bonuses are added to any properties the weapon already has, 
		but duplicate abilities do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at 
		least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties 
		can be added. The bonus and properties granted by the spirit are 
		determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the 
		spirit is called again. The celestial spirit imparts no bonuses if the 
		weapon is held by anyone other than the paladin but resumes giving 
		bonuses if returned to the paladin. These bonuses apply to only one end 
		of a double weapon.</p>
	<p>If a weapon bonded with a celestial spirit is destroyed, Dyllon loses the 
	use of this ability for 30 days, or until he gains a level, whichever comes 
	first. During this 30-day period, Dyllon takes a –1 penalty on attack and 
	weapon damage rolls. </p>
	<h4 class="bluebar"><a name="Renown"></a>Renown (Ex)</h4>
		<p>Dyllon is known for deeds and abilities regardless of his current 
		identity. This renown grants him favorable treatment in civilized 
		company and lends him an air of menace while facing down his enemies. 
		Whenever he is in his social identity, all NPCs in Gracklstugh have a 
		starting attitude toward him that is one category better, as long as 
		each person's initial attitude would have at least been indifferent (see 
		the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/diplomacy">Diplomacy</a>&nbsp;skill 
		description). He gains a +4&nbsp;<a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Circumstance-Bonus">circumstance 
		bonus</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/intimidate">Intimidate</a>&nbsp;checks 
		whenever he is in his vigilante identity. This bonus applies only while 
		he is with 3 miles of Gracklstugh. </p>
	<h4 class="bluebar"><a name="Safe-House"></a>Safe House (Ex)</h4>
		<p>Dyllon has a safe house in Gracklstugh. This safe house must be an 
		area no larger in volume than a 30-foot cube. The safe house can be 
		arranged any way he likes and it can be part of a larger building, like 
		a secret room or an underground cave. Objects within this safe house 
		can't be located by any effect that is less powerful than a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/discern-location">discern 
		location</a>&nbsp;spell.</p>
