	<p>Lolth is a cruel, capricious deity who embodies the absolute evil of the 
	drow. She is malicious in her 
	dealings with others and coldly vicious in a fight, and is among the most 
	powerful of all deities. Some believe her to be insane, because she pits her 
	own worshippers against one another in an endless struggle fot station. She can be kind and aid 
	those that she fancies, but she thrives on the death, destruction, and 
	torture of anyone, including those of her own worshipers that have 
	displeased her. Although she can appear in the form of a giant black widow 
	spider with crimson eyes, her true form is that of a human-sized, 
	exquisitely beautiful female drow.</p>
    	<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1923646/D%26D/Monsters/Deities/Lolth.jpg">
    <img class="a" src="Lolth.jpg" width="35%" style="float: left; margin-left: 0px; margin-right : 20px"/></a>
	<p>Lolth's church promotes the superiority of the Queen of Spiders over all 
	other beings. As such, her church is hated by duergar, svirdneblin, and 
	other races for the cruelty of her clerics. In most cities, her clerics control the 
	noble houses and thus the cities themselves. Her clerics act as the rulers, 
	police force, judges, juries, and executioners of their society. Their cruel 
	and capricious acts are designed to keep the citizens in fear of them and 
	hateful of outsiders. Elves who venerate other 
	deities, as well as all male drow who pay her homage, revile the church of 
	the Spider Queen for its power&mdash;though they would sieze such power for 
	themselves if they coul.</p>
	<p>Clerics of Lolth pray for spells after waking from trance or before 
	retiring to trance. Her clerics are always female. Lolth requires regular 
	homage from her clerics: submission in prayer, plus offerings. Lolth's aid 
	requires sacrifices, traditionally the blood of drow faithful or captured 
	foes, spilled with a spider-shaped knife whose eight descending legs are 
	blades. Rituals customarily take place among women only, in a sacred room or 
	area, but those requiring extraordinary power or a public display may be 
	celebrated in the open an in mixed company. The most powerful ceremonies 
	defy description and are seldom seen by nondrow.</p>
	<p>Rituals to Lolth involve the burning of precious oils and incense, live 
	offerings, and riches of all sorts, particularly gems. These are customarily 
	placed in a bowl-shaped depression in a black altar or burning brazier, from 
	which black-and-red flames leap to consume offerings. If the deity is 
	angered, flames may also arc to consume other valuables, such as magic 
	items, jewelry, and clothing. Large, important rituals customarily use eight 
	braziers, to provide additional flame and to represent Lolth's eight legs.</p>
	<p>Lolth allows herself to be contacted directly only when it pleases her to 
	do so. Otherwise, the call reaches her servant yochlols (amorphous demons 
	able to take the form of an elf or a spider). When Lolth is displeased, she 
	sends a yochlol or myrlochar (a spider demon of lesser rank) to attack the 
	cleric. Lolth's clerics sometimes multiclass as fighters or sorcerers.</p>

	<h3>Dogma</h3>
	<p>Fear is as strong as steel, while love and respect are soft and useless. 
	Convert or destroy nonbeliever drow. Weed out the weak and the rebellious. 
	Destroy impugners of the faith. Sacrifice males, slaves, and those of other 
	races who ignore the commands of Lolth or her clerics. Raise children to 
	praise and fear Lolth; each family should produce at least one cleric to 
	serve her. Questioning Lolth's motives or wisdom is a sin, as is aiding 
	nondrow against the drow, or ignoring Lolth's commands for the sake of a 
	lover. Revere arachnids of all kinds; those who kill or mistreat a spider 
	must die.</p>
