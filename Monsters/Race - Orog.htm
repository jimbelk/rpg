<TITLE>Race - Orog</TITLE>

<div class="wholedoc">
	<h1>Orog</h1>
	<img class="a" width="300px" src="Orog.jpg"/><p>Orogs are the primary race 
	of orcs on this world. Physically, an orog looks similar to a usual large orc, except that the ears 
	are somewhat larger, and their eyes are huge and pale. They average six and 
	a half feet tall.</p>
	<p>Orogs have mastered the art of forging armor and weapons from the strange 
	ores found beneath the ground. They favor half-plate and full plate armor, 
	which are typically adorned with armor spikes. Orog weapons are festooned 
	with a multitude of hooks, spines, and redundant cutting edges. An orog 
	rarely goes anywhere without being fully armed and armored.</p>
	<p><strong>Outlook:</strong> Orogs are less warlike than typical orcs. They 
	do not revel in the act of war, but they do enjoy its spoils. They are quick 
	to rise to battle, but afterward they fall back to enjoy the fruits of their 
	victories. The concept of leading a horde of raging orcs on a pointless 
	crusade that only ends when the last aggressor falls, still advancing, is 
	alien to the mindset of the orog. Why go to war if you can't enjoy the 
	results?</p>
	<p><strong>Society: </strong>Deep underground, the orogs use slave labor to 
	expand caverns into well-defended cities. These cities are completely 
	enclosed in the rock and consist of huge, seemingly endless rooms connected 
	by numerous large processionals and public squares. Orog cities often 
	consist of layers, with rooms atop rooms atop rooms. Nobility usually 
	resides in the highest chambers, which are accessed by trapped stairwells 
	and vertical shafts with crude rope lifts. Orog cities such as these can 
	house upwards of eight thousand orogs and up to three times that many 
	slaves.</p>
	<p>Most orog cities are much smaller and are comprised of only a few hundred 
	orogs and slaves. Most Upperworld citites are like this, although they mimic 
	the larger cities' tendency to consist of dozens (if not hundreds) of 
	interconnected small rooms. </p>
	<p>The one thing that binds together all orog societies is the placement 
	of the forges. Orogs have a long tradition of armor-smithing and weapon 
	forging, and the first thing a tribe of orogs look for when they pick a site 
	for a new town is a natural place to set up a forge. Volcanic vents and 
	pools of magma are favorites, but more traditional forges built on epic 
	scales serve as well. Orog forges are community-held, and any orog is 
	welcome to build armor and weaponry at the forge just as long as what is 
	produced is either put to immediate personal use or placed in the community 
	armory.</p>
	<p><strong>Alignment and Religion:</strong> Most orogs worship Gruumsh 
	Certain fringe cults of orogs in the Lowerworld have started worshiping 
	Ghaunadaur, but these orogs avoid their more traditional kin. Religion is an 
	established facet of orog society, but not an overwhelming one. In many 
	cities, orog clerics are thought of as little more than healers, the average 
	orog having little interest in spiritual matters.</p>
	<p><strong>Relations with Other Races:</strong> Those orogs who remain deep 
	underground often engage in more or less friendly trade with the gray 
	dwarves and the drow, who value the productivity of orog mines enough to let 
	orog cities alone. The orogs often make war on the svirfneblin, but they try 
	to avoid the more alien races such as the illithids and aboleth, whose 
	mental powers can cut down even the mightiest orog with ease.</p>
	<p><strong>Pets:</strong> A typical orog lair not only includes two to 
	three times the orog population in various humanoid slaves, but also a large 
	number of war-trained animals as well. They often train giant lizards and 
	dire bats as steeds or guardians. In some of the larger orog cities, they 
	keep creatures like thoqqua and even salamanders or fire elementals as 
	guardians for their forges.</p>
	<p><strong>Equipment:</strong> Orogs are loath to use armor or weaponry 
	of less than masterwork quality; any weapons they construct that fall below 
	this expected level of quality are usually set aside for young orogs to 
	practice with. They have little interest in some of the more exotic types of 
	weaponry found in the world, preferring to use relatively simple weapons 
	instead. The greatsword is the orogs' favorite melee weapon, and they 
	find that throwing axes make good use of their high Strength in the close 
	quarters of many battles.</p>
	<p><strong>Adventurers:</strong> Most orog characters are fighters or 
	barbarians, but a few become rangers, rogues, clerics, or sorcerers.</p>
