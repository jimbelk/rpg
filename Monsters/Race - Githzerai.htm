	<h1>Githzerai</h1>
	<img class="a" width="350px" src="Githzerai.jpg"/><p>Githzerai are a 
	hard-hearted, humanlike people who reside in hidden monasteries on the plane 
	of Limbo. They are a race of ascetics who are fascinated by the mysteries of 
	the inner self and spend their lives harnessing the power of their minds and 
	their spirits. Some githzerai travel far and wide across the planes, 
	opposing the sinister plots of both mind flayers and their own kin the 
	warlike githyanki.</p>
	<p><strong>Personality:</strong> Githzerai rarely use two words when one 
	will do. They tend to be cynical and suspicious, and they generally expect 
	the worst in people. Githzerai don’t waste time on fools, and are rarely 
	moved to help those unprepared to help themselves. They are pragmatic to a 
	fault, slow to give trust, and cautious in their dealings with others.</p>
	<p>Many githzerai disdain creature comforts and live their lives in ascetic 
	discipline. Their settlements and strongholds resemble monasteries more than 
	villages.</p>
	<p><strong>Physical Description:</strong> Githzerai are tall, gaunt 
	humanoids averaging a little over 6 feet tall and typically weighing around 
	160 pounds. They have rough, yellow skin and russet hair, although the 
	habitually shave their heads. Their noses are almost flat, their eyes are 
	dull yellow or gray, and their ears are pointed. Githzerai favor drab robes 
	and avoid ostentatious dress.</p>
	<p><strong>Relations:</strong> The githzerai have at times allied themselves 
	with the drow, duergar, and svirfneblin to fight their common illithid 
	enemies.</p>
	<p>While githzerai are usually calm and disciplined in their conduct, they 
	feel nothing but cold, purposeful hatred for githyanki and mind flayers. 
	They also have a bitter rivalry with the slaadi; despite that, the two races 
	cooperate sometimes when faced with a common danger.</p>
	<p><strong>Alignment and Religion:</strong> Githzerai tend to be pragmatic 
	and self-serving, but they are not malicious and do not look to get ahead at 
	the expense of others. Most are neutral with respect to good or evil. 
	Githzerai are not particularly religious and rarely venerate any deity. 
	Instead, they seek enlightenment within their own minds. They revere the 
	immortal wizard-king of their race, but they do not worship him and do not 
	gain divine spells from their reverence.</p>
	<p><strong>Githzerai Society:</strong> The githzerai forerunners united 
	under the command of the rebel Gith and threw down the plane-spanning empire 
	of the mind flayers. Once free, the former slaves split ideologically and 
	eventually racially, becoming the githzerai and their foes, the githyanki. 
	The githzerai’s history of imprisonment was the foundation of their monastic 
	lifestyle, in which all githzerai learn from childhood how to eradicate 
	potential oppressors and enemies (anyone not a githzerai).</p>
	<p>Githzerai live within self-contained, fortress-like monasteries hidden 
	deep in the swirling chaos of Limbo. While disorder rules outside, stability 
	holds sway inside. Each monastery is ultimately under the control of a 
	sensei, a monk of at least 16th level, and follows a strict schedule of 
	chants, meals, martial arts training, and devotions, according to a 
	particular sensei’s philosophy.</p>
	<p><strong>Language:</strong> Githzerai speak Gith, a language they share 
	with the githyanki. They also speak Undercommon.</p>
	<p><strong>Names:</strong> Githzerai do not place much importance on family 
	or clan, preferring to organize their society by merit. They have developed 
	a wealth of traditional titles and ranks that are awarded to individuals as 
	they become warranted, and they refer to one another by simple names in 
	daily life.</p>
	<p><em>Titles:</em> Zerth, Ur-zerth, Fell Hand, Master of Elements, 
	Planewalker, Swordthane, Spellthane, Rrathmal, Storvakal.</p>
	<p><em>Male Names:</em> Dak, Duurth, Ferzth, Greth, Hurm, Kalla, Muurg, 
	Nurm, Shrakk.</p>
	<p><em>Female Names:</em> Adaka, Adeya, Ella, Ezhelya, Immilzin, Izera, 
	Uweya.</p>
	<p><strong>Adventurers: </strong>Githzerai are self-sufficient and form few 
	attachments to home or family. As a result, many are noted wanderers who 
	need little reason to set off on journeys across the planes. To a githzerai, 
	the physical journey is a metaphor for the inner one, and many adventurers 
	are content to pass year after year in remote lands.</p>
	<p>Githzerai prefer psionics to magic and prefer unarmed combat to combat 
	with weapons. They are often
