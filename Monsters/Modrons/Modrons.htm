	<h1>Modrons</h1>
	<img class="a" src="Modrons.jpg" width="40%"/>
	<p>What’s a mortal to make of the modrons—those strange creatures of 
	absolute order that whir and click along in the Clockwork Nirvana of 
	Mechanus? To an outsider, they seem to have no existence other than as a 
	whole. Indeed, there is a saying: “To look at one modron is to look at all 
	of them.&rdquo;</p>
	<p>It is only logical that these creatures are native to Mechanus. Rumor has 
	it that they are the keepers of their mechanical plane, the maintainers of 
	the gears and the polishers of the cogs. Modrons keep the whole place 
	running smoothly and cleanly—without them, Mechanus would surely break down.</p>
	<p>Though the majority of modrons live in Regulus (their own city in 
	Mechanus), they can be encountered anywhere within the planes. No modron is 
	ever without a task to carry out, though these tasks may be no more 
	comprehensible to other creatures than the modrons themselves are.</p>
	<p>Just what are the goals of these creatures of ultimate order? Do they 
	want to impose total law over the rest of the cosmos? Are they simply 
	keepers of the machinery that drives the multiverse—the repair unit of 
	infinity? Or are they devious players on the cosmic gameboard, trying to 
	eliminate their competition? These questions may never be answered, and a 
	host more may never be asked. No one but a modron truly understands a 
	modron.</p>
	<h2>Modrons</h2>
	<p>The city of Regulus occupies sixty-four of the coglike wheels of 
	Mechanus, called sectors. Each group of four sectors is called a region, and 
	each group of four regions is called a quarter. Modrons of increasingly 
	greater authority oversee each of these units, and over it all reigns 
	Primus, the One and the Prime, supreme ruler of all modrons. The Tower of 
	Primus stands at the hub of the central cog and the modron cathedral (see 
	below) rises from one close by.</p>
	<h2>Modron Castes</h2>
	<p>In all, there are more than 360 million modrons, divided into fifteen 
	ranks, or castes. Castes are hardly unique, but the modron approach to them 
	is. Each caste has not only its own functions, but its own body shape as 
	well. Thus, a modron’s physical appearance is a direct indicator of its 
	rank.</p>
	<p>The castes are further categorized into base modrons and hierarch 
	modrons. Base modrons perform mundane tasks; hierarch modrons plan and 
	organize, oversee others, and manage entire areas. At the top of the list, 
	of course, is Primus.</p>
	<p>From greatest to least, the fifteen modron castes are listed on the table 
	below. Listed with each is the number of modrons in that caste and a brief 
	description of their duties in Regulus. Primus and the hierarch modrons are 
	also capable of telepathic communication, and the range of that power is 
	given in a separate column.</p>
