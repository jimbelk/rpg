<div class="wholedoc">
	<h1>Lumi (33&nbsp;RP)</h1>
	<img class="a" width="350px" src="Lumi.jpg"/>
	<p><em>A solemn and dignified head floats about six inches above the 
	shoulders of the otherwise headless body of this stocky humanoid creature. 
	The being's skin softly glows, and white light peeks between the cracks of 
	its armor.</em></p>
	<p>The lumi are a race of warriors and healers who live on the Positive 
	Energy Plane. There they build towering cities of glass and light that are 
	protected from intruders simply by virtue of the plane's dangers to 
	nonnative life. The power of<br>unchecked positive energy keeps all but the 
	most curious from even reaching their doorstep.</p>
	<p>The lumi worship Light as a concept rather than owing allegiance to any 
	deity. They praise its ability to uncover that which is hidden and see it as 
	a symbol of purity and truth. The lumi themselves are honest to a fault and 
	are known for their inability to hold back from telling others blunt and 
	unflattering truths. They despise deception above all other offenses, and 
	lies (or even simple illusion spells) are capital crimes within their 
	settlements. Lumi often travel to the Material Plane to battle wielders of 
	negative energy or known deceivers. This can make them alliesof good-aligned 
	adventurers for a time, but they put their own code of honesty and truth 
	ahead of the well-being of others. They think nothing of slaying those who 
	offend their morality.</p>
	<p>An average lumi stands between 5 and 7 feet in height and weighs 100 to 
	300 pounds.</p>

	</ul>
	<p style="font-weight:bold;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;margin-left:20px">
	Defense Racial Traits</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Body of Light (Su, 4&nbsp;RP):</strong> A lumi's body is infused 
		with a softly glowing positive energy. It is immune to all death spells, 
		magical death effects, energy drain, and any negative energy effects 
		(such as from <em>inflict</em> spells or <em>chill touch</em>). </li>
		<li><strong>Planar Adaptation:</strong> Lumi are adapted to live on the 
		Positive Energy Plane. They never gain additional temporary hit points 
		as a result of being on a plane with the major positive-dominant energy 
		trait, and thus are never in danger of exploding when on the Positive 
		Energy Plane. They still gain full benefit from the fast healing ability 
		of planes with any positive-energy trait.</li>
		<li><strong>Halo: </strong>A lumi sheds white light in a 5-foot radius 
		at all times. It cannot voluntarily suppress this ability, though the 
		light can be concealed by spells that create darkness</li>
		<li><strong>Clear Vision (1&nbsp;RP):</strong> A lumi cannot be blinded or 
		dazzled by any effect. It can still be effectively blind due to 
		concealment, such as by darkness or fog. It is specifically immune to
		<em>color spray</em>, <em>rainbow pattern</em>, <em>searing light</em>,
		<em>sunbeam</em>, <em>sunburst</em>, or other effects that use direct 
		light as an attack form (such as a ghaele's light ray attack). <em>Sun 
		blades</em> deal only nonlethal<br>damage to a lumi.</li>
		<li><strong>Floating Head (1&nbsp;RP):</strong> A lumi's head naturally 
		floats a few inches above its shoulders. The creature can rotate its 
		head in any direction but cannot raise, lower, or otherwise move its 
		head away from where it floats; an unseen force prevents others from 
		moving its head as well. Opponents who flank a lumi do not gain the 
		normal +2 bonus on attack rolls. Lumi are immune to the decapitation 
		power of a vorpal weapon. They may not be strangled and are immune to 
		suffocation.</li>
