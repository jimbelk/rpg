<TITLE>Race - Shadar-Kai</TITLE>

<div class="wholedoc">
	<h1>Shadar-Kai</h1>
	<img class="a" width="250px" src="Shadar-Kai.png"/>
	<p>The shadar-kai, or shadow fey, are a race of bitter, determined<br>folk 
	whose souls are poisoned by shadow</p>
	<p>Long ago, the shadar-kai thought to preserve the world from the rising 
	humanoid races. Skilled in shadow magic, the shadar-kai made a pact with a 
	dark power of the Plane of Shadow to cast the world into an endless twilight 
	in which the shadow fey would rule supreme. But the experiment went awry, 
	and the shadar-kai were left bound to the Plane of Shadow, cursed to lose 
	their souls in its dark depths. This shadow curse affects shadar-kai to this 
	day, and every member of the race is engaged in a lifelong struggle to stave 
	off inevitable doom.</p>
	<p>The continuous pull of the Plane of Shadow has left the shadar-kai grim 
	and embattled. Few races understand the plight of the shadow fey. Even the 
	temporary solutions the shadar-kai have found leave them struggling with 
	constant pain, making them vicious. Their willingness to commit acts of 
	cruelty and violence has increased with<br>each generation.</p>
	<p><strong>Physical Description: </strong>Gray-skinned and dark-eyed, the 
	slender shadar-kai stand slightly taller than average humans, and their soft 
	movements exude grace and uncanny stealth. Shadow follows the shadar-kai 
	wherever they go. Shadows cast by the folds of their clothing seem deeper 
	than those on humanoids, and a shadar-kai can seemingly fade out of sight by 
	simply stepping into any common shadow.</p>
	<p>The shadar-kai prefer light weapons suited for grace and agility, 
	especially spiked chains. Many shadar-kai favor a variety of piercings and 
	tattoos.</p>
	<p><strong>Society: </strong>The shadar-kai have developed a predatory 
	society. They have few permanent cities of their own but can often be found 
	in other settlements. The cities built by humans and other intelligent races 
	have little chance of keeping out a determined group of shadar-kai 
	infiltrators because such cities are full of shadows.</p>
	<p>The few shadar-kai cities that remain on the Material Plane are concealed 
	by illusions and shadow magic, and well guarded by bands of shadar-kai 
	scouts leading shadow mastiffs. Many shadar-kai have been subsumed into the 
	Plane of Shadow, and even the greatest cities of the shadarkai are desolate, 
	sparsely populated places.</p>
	<p>Most shadar-kai realms are magocracies, ruled by powerful illusionists. 
	Shadar-kai hate other fey, and they hunt and kill those fey unlucky enough 
	to cross their path. Occasionally shadar-kai make alliances with other evil 
	fey, usually to deceive or infiltrate a population of good humanoids.</p>
	<p><strong>Alignment and Religion:</strong> Shadar-kai are usually neutral 
	evil. They worship the
	<a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Raven_Queen">Raven Queen</a>, 
	a divine being who lives in the Fortress of Memories in the Shadowfell.</p>
	<p><strong>Adventurers:</strong> Although rogues are by far the most common 
	characters among the shadow fey, many other shadar-kai become wizards or 
	clerics. Few shadar-kai are strong in melee combat, so they rarely do well 
	as fighters, rangers, monks, or barbarians.&nbsp; Most shadar-kai use 
	special magic items crafted by their people (see the <em>Fiend Folio</em>).</p>
	<p><strong>Tactics:</strong> Cursed and blessed with a great affinity for 
	the Plane of Shadow, the shadar-kai are subtle and deceptive. They steal 
	without being detected when they can, striking<br>from ambush when 
	necessary. Spellcasters among the shadar-kai favor shadow and illusion 
	magic, and few groups of the shadow fey are without a powerful spellcasting 
	leader. Skilled at stealth and gifted with visual acuity greater than that 
	of most other creatures, the shadar-kai have little trouble making sure that 
	combat occurs on their terms.</p>
	<h3 class="auto-style1">Racial Traits</h3>

		Fey</li>

	<p style="font-weight:bold;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;margin-left:20px">
	Defense Racial Traits</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Hide in Plain Sight (Su):</strong> Shadar-kai can use the 
		Stealth skill even while being observed. As long as they are not 
		illuminated by natural daylight, the daylight spell, or a similar 
		magical light, shadar-kai can hide themselves from view in the open 
		without having anything to actually hide behind.</li>
	</ul>
	<p style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;margin-left:20px" class="auto-style3">
	Skills and Feats Racial Traits</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Proficiencies:</strong> All shadar-kai are proficient with 
		light armor and with the spiked chain.</li>
		<li><strong>Shadow Stealth:</strong> Shadar-kai have a +10 racial bonus 
		on Stealth checks made in dark or shadowy conditions.</li>
	</ul>
	<p style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;margin-left:20px" class="auto-style3">
	Senses Racial Traits</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Superior Low-Light Vision (Ex):</strong> Shadar-kai have 
		extraordinary vision in low-light conditions. They can see four times as 
		far as a human in low-light conditions.</li>
	</ul>
	<p style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:thin;margin-left:20px" class="auto-style3">
	Magic Racial Traits</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Shadow Curse (Su):</strong> The Plane of Shadow exerts a
		tremendous pull on shadar-kai's soul, which is only tenuously connected 
		to its mortal body. Any time a shadar-kai is stunned, dazed, staggered, 
		or unconscious (other than from natural sleep), the shadow fey must make 
		a Will save (DC 15) or lose a portion of her soul to the Plane of 
		Shadow. The shadar-kai must also attempt a save any time she removes a 
		gal-ralan, if she has one (see Shadar-Kai Items, below).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A shadar-kai 
		with a damaged soul gains one negative level that cannot be removed 
		until she restores her soul completely. If exposed to another event that 
		requires a save against the shadow curse, a shadar-kai may gain 
		additional negative levels. A shadar-kai on the Plane of Shadow can 
		transfix her soul to her body again with a <em>greater restoration</em> 
		spell. A shadar-kai on the Material Plane (or elsewhere) must use a <em>
		wish</em> or <em>miracle</em> spell to restore her soul.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		A shadar-kai afflicted with the shadow curse cannot be raised from the 
		dead or resurrected, and cannot gain experience. The touch of the shadow 
		curse galls a shadar-kai, filling her heart with an icy emptiness that 
		eventually drives all but the most determined individuals to capitulate 
		and leave the Material Plane altogether.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A 
		shadar-kai who goes to the Plane of Shadow and remains there ameliorates 
		the effects of the shadow curse and suffers no ill effects. However, if 
		she leaves the Plane of Shadow without restoring her soul, she suffers 
		the effects of the shadow curse until she returns to the Plane of Shadow 
		or restores her soul.</li>
