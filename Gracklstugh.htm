	<img src="Gracklstugh2.jpg" style="float: right; padding-left: 10px" width="50%"><h1>Gracklstugh, 
	City of Blades</h1>
	<p>Seat of the duergar Deepkingdom, Gracklstugh is the strongest gray dwarf 
	realm in the North and arguably in all of the world. The 
	ceiling is perpetually covered with thick, reeking smoke that rises from 
	the city's countless forges and smelters. The duergar smiths who live 
	here turn out quality weapons and armor of all kinds. Most of their wares 
	are for sale, and their largest markets are other duergar and drow.</p>
	<p>Gracklstugh straddles a narrow rift known as Laduguer's Furrow. The north 
	end of the settlement is a pebbly beach on the Darklake. Gracklstugh proper 
	is a huge city, but its various outlying districts and fungus fields occupy 
	the tunnels for miles around, pushing the total population of the 
	Deepkingdom to around 90,000 duergar, plus another 60,000 slaves.</p>
	<p>Like other major communities, Gracklstugh is strong in trade. The duergar 
	usually prefer to carry their wares out to markets elsewhere rather than 
	welcome external traders, so caravans containing top-quality weapons, armor, 
	and other metal goods constantly leave the city for Menzoberranzan, 
	Mantol-Derith, Skullport, Sshamath, and Ooltul. The City of Blades earned 
	its name because of its reputation for quality weapons, so no one complains 
	to the duergar's faces about the markup for transportation costs.</p>
	<p>The main cavern of Gracklstugh is dominated by colossal stalagmites that 
	have been hollowed out and converted into great stinking smelters. The city 
	glows with firelight and the ruddy yellow gleam of hot iron at all times, 
	and the air is filled with hissing steam, reeking smoke, and the endless 
	clanging of hammers. The folk of Gracklstugh practice many trades besides 
	smithwork, but the heart of the city is the working of metal.</p>
	<img style="float: left; padding-right: 10px" src="RedDragon.jpg" width="50%"><p>The red dragon Themberchaud, known as the Wyrmsmith of Gracklstugh, keeps 
	the forges of the city hot with his fiery breath. An order of duergar 
	cleric/psions known as the Keepers of the Flame tends to the red dragon and 
	guards his hoard while he slithers around the city, blasting the forges to 
	life with his flame. In return for this magnanimous service, Themberchaud's 
	hoard is regularly fattened, and he feasts on ill-tempered slaves.</p>
	<p>Gracklstugh is a city of endless toil. Each trade or craft practiced in 
	the city is the domain of a specific clan. Important trades such as foundry 
	work are the province of several competing clans, but other clans working at 
	less important (or necessary) tasks often consist of a few dozen craftsfolk 
	at best. The families that govern each clan comprise the city's nobility, 
	and the leader of a clan is known as a laird. Duergar clans do not war with 
	one another; gray dwarves who find themselves at the bottom of the pecking 
	order tend to resign themselves to their fate or work harder to advance, 
	rather than plotting to pull down their betters.</p>
	<h2>Places in Gracklstugh</h2>
	<h3 style="padding-top:20px">Darklake District</h3>
	<p>The northern part of the city is known as the &quot;Darklake district&quot;. 
	Several inns, taverns, and businesses catering to travelers can be found 
	here, as well as dismal marketplaces for duergar wares. The gray dwarves do 
	not permit folk of other races to venture any deeper into theb city without 
	a sizable escort. </p>
	<img src="DuergarStatues.jpg" style="float:right; padding-left: 10px; padding-top: 10px" width="50%"/><h3>Overlake Hold</h3>
	<p><em>Dunglorrin Torune</em>, which translates as Overlake Hold, is a 
	fortress and temple dedicated to Laduguer carved into the heart of a massive 
	stalagmite on the shore of the Darklake. Overlake Hold is the main fortress 
	of the Stone Guard, which functions as both the watch and regular army of 
	the Deepkingdom. The hold bristles with large chimneys from which smoke 
	billows and ledges from which catapults can hurl stones at waterborne 
	invaders.</p>
	<h3>Darklake Docks</h3>
	<p>These busy docks are used primarily by flat-bottomed rafts made of 
	zurkhwood and lacquered puffball floats. Some of these ramshackle barges are 
	powered by mindless undead, such as skeletons or zombies, that are bolted to 
	the oars or paddlewheels and used as tireless necromantic engines. The rafts 
	are ungainly, but each can carry tons of trade goods, and the duergar send 
	out shipments with pure dwarven consistency.</p>
	<h3>Laduguer's Furrow</h3>
	<p>This rift breaks the city into northern and southern districts. Nearly 
	200 feet deep, the rift has a packed gravel floor and extends roughly 1/4 
	mile beyond the main grotto of the city in both directions. Dwellings are 
	carved into the sides of the rift, and wide ramps lead to the bottom from 
	the main level of the city.</p>
	<p>The eastern section of the rift is the city's derro quarter. Almost all 
	of Gracklstugh's derro congregate here, generally keeping to themselves. The 
	savants have their own secret passages leading to the caves beyond the city, 
	and derro can come or go by these routes as they please.</p>
	<img src="Stonespeaker.jpg" style="float:left; padding-right: 10px" width="35%"><h3>Cairngorm Cavern</h3>
	<p>This remote section of the city, set back several hundred feet from the 
	main cavern, houses the stone giants of Clan Cairngorm. Led by the strict Stonespeaker Hgraan, the giants are loyal to the Deep King and do not fear 
	the derro.</p>
	<h3>Whorlstone Tunnels</h3>
	<p>The Whorlstone Tunnels are a cavern system extending panially underneath 
	Gracklstugh, away from the mines and passages the city's inhabitants use 
	regularly. The long, gently curving tunnels have relatively regular 
	dimensions. They are known for their unusual rock formations and abundant 
	patches of fungi, and for the many large <em>lightstones </em>that can be 
	found throughout the tunnels.</p>
